1.0,21 year old male been dealing with anxiety ever since I can remember. I think I’ve found my happy place and ways of dealing with it. For me to be anxiety free everything has to be almost spot on with my routine. I find that when I’m getting regular exercise with regular meals I’m fine. Every time I drink alcohol not to much whilst but after and the day after I get hit with this anxiety. It’s crippling some days I can’t even leave the house or face anyone. I think it is due to doing stupid shot when I’m drunk so every time I sober up now I’m thinking to myself if I did any stupid shit or said anything dumb whilst drunk. I also over think everything and I think people are always staring at me which sounds so entitled and selfish but it’s the way I feel. Like I said for me to be completely anxiety free is when I’m at home usually out side in the sun chilling with my dogs or when I am at work. I don’t care about anything else. I just want to be happy with my family. I’m sick of having these episodes everytime I drink. Any advice or tips would be much appreciated,Anxiety,Alcohol induced,Drug and Alcohol,LD DA 1.csv
1.0,I have had anxiety pretty much my whole life.  It developed very quickly in adolescence around puberty and when it hit just about max level we moved.  New school new city.  From a very small private school to a much larger public school.  I also found out some interesting things about my family.  I had zero trust in the people who were supposed to be closest to me.  Who was I supposed to tell about the why I was feeling upside down. So I developed coping technics that I thought I had perfected.  Avoid anything that makes me uncomfortable as much as I can.  And when forced to do these things puke my guts out in the morning and then don’t eat because i know that will make everything ten times worse.  As I got older I discovered alcohol and that it made me brave and loud and stupid.  That progressed into figuring out how to use it in small doses to control the anxiety in any social environment.  I know how to control my anxiety I know the exact things I need to do what to tell myself when it happens who to call to calm me down.  And the easiest and fastest way.  Alcohol.I appear on the outside like I know what’s going on with me.  I can present myself as a normal human most of the time.  However this is not healthy.

1.0,"Ever since I was a child I’ve had sleep anxiety. I fight off sleeping because I’m so sure that in my sleep I’m going to die. Well, I fear that I’m going to wake up in the process of dying. As a college student I found out I could combat this by drinking large quantities of alcohol. Ill just drink till I’m exhausted, pass out, and usually get an alright night of sleep. Unfortunately, this hasn’t really stopped and now I’m age 30. If I don’t drink, I have extreme difficulty sleeping. But, once I finally get tired, the anxiety kicks in and I start to fight the drowsiness. It’s been a terrible cycle. 

I’ve recently stopped drinking liquor, which has really helped my overall daily anxiety/panic. I do however, still take a low dosage preventative benzo in the morning before work. By the time I get home from work I’ll drink a few beers, and I’ve never had any problems with this combination (don’t try this at home kids). Today though, I took a different med since I ran out of the usual. When I got home, I had one beer (12oz 9.1%) and my world got rocked. I tried my absolute hardest to fight off this combo taking over my brain and I couldn’t win. I got knocked the F out by this combo. I woke up in a panic, and here I am, afraid to fall back asleep.

1.0,"Hi everyone,

A bit of a background. I had two full blown seizures when I was roughly 8 I believe. I went on tegretol but there was only the two seizures. Apparently it was chalked up to an infection/fever, as far as I know these seizures occurred within a week of one another.

Fast forward to last year and I had my first ever panic attack, it was whilst I was driving and it was honestly horrendous. I had recently unexpectedly lost my mother and had been a functioning alcohol for three years, I think this is what caused the panic attacks. For some unknown reason, a thought came into my head that questioned if it was epilepsy. I have no idea where this came from but it was so powerful that the thought stuck. I decided to quit alcohol cold turkey which inevitably caused the anxiety to worsen over time. This resulted in me going to hospital as my vitamin levels had tanked as I was completely exhausted and done.

Now the next part I can't explain. I've always had health anxiety but for some reason I became fixated with epilepsy. I was incredibly anxious about it and it was all I could think about.

Fast forward another month and although I'm still anxious about it, I've somewhat made my peace with it until one day, I was buying something off of Amazon. On their homepage, there was these orange storage lockers and something clicked in my mind that made me aware that I had seen these before but could not place it. I instantly started to have a panic attack, the whole time I was searching my mind to figure out where I had seen these before. It was like a flashback that I couldn't remember. So a few hours later it clicked that I had seen these two days prior when I dropped off a friend to pick up a parcel from one of these lockers.

I try not to think anything of it, but I start to acutely become aware that I am now on high alert for when I start to remember something but it fades, kind of like when you wake up from a dream and the more you think of it, it starts to fade away until its completely gone. At the time the only way I could sum it up was deja vu, it was an eerily fond memory but no recollection of the memory.

During a routine review of my antidepressant, my doctor wanted to know more about my panic attacks. I must of said some keywords because she scheduled me for an appointment with a neurologist the very next day. Apparently this was due to my two seizures as a child.

I explain the panic attacks to the neurologist and the ""déjà vu"". He instantly puts me on elsicarbazepine acetate 400mg then up to 800mg. He is unsure what to diagnose, but on the balance of probability due to childhood seizures, he is 51%/49 in favour of starting the medication until there is an outcome.

During the five months on this medication, these episodes of dream flashbacks continue to occur. The best way I could sum these up is that they are like deja vu, but with a memory I cannot place. Sometimes I can think on the brief image or memory and figure out what it was (like the Amazon lockers). Other times I cannot. I think the weirdest one I had was when I was stood next to a river and I got this sudden onset of anxiety and an image pop up in my mind of a dancing banana... what the hell, right? I continued to think on this for weeks and then one day it clicked. Remember that dancing banana from the Peanut Butter Jelly Time video? It was that...

These continued to happen during my entire time of this medication. As I said, I'm incredibly anxious when it comes to health and my body was hyper sensitive and aware to any physical or psychological changes.

I have asked a lot of people, I have read so many experiences that others have had like mine. They range from people with anxiety, derealisation, depersonalisation, epilepsy, depression.

I've been cleared by medical professionals who have heard me explain this symptom and I am quite frankly embarrassed as I feel like I wasted their time. They have diagnosed me with anxiety but there is this constant what if that bounces around all day and it isn't normal to dedicate this much time and effort to worrying about an all clear.

1.0,"I tried ecstasy for the first time last month, and did it 2 more times after that. That’s a total of 3 times. 

Currently it’s been a month and a couple days and I’ve developed extreme anxiety. Im starting to think the ecstasy might have something to do with it, I’m not 100% sure though. I’ve noticed what triggers my anxiety the MOST is MUSIC and small spaces where I feel claustrophobic.

I’ve never had an issue with anxiety before, until literally last month. 
I’m about to go into details below and explain, Idk if anyone cares that deeply. If you do read it, please let me know if you think it was the ecstasy. 😭

I’ve been smoking for 5 years (an everyday thing, about 5-7 blunts a day) but recently it’s starting to give me panic/anxiety attacks, ESPECIALLY WHEN I LISTEN TO MUSIC. 
I used to smoke and listen to music every morning, as it ironically HELPED with stress and so on... Now when I smoke and listen to music I start to almost become really light headed, and my heartbeat starts racing and I always start to think I’m going faint. 

I thought it was the weed, but I’ve came to the conclusion, the music plays a huge part in it as well. When I turn off the music I can usually calm my self down. 

Also two days ago I was at a party smoking and the music was BLASTING, It made me uncomfortable to the point where I was convinced (lord forbid) that I was going to have a heart attack. I started to feel the left side of my neck hurt and pulse, and I became almost faint. I was so scared.

I don’t think, I need to explain the claustrophobic part, but f*ck it right. I was attempting to ride a greyhound bus, which I’ve done before but I literally can’t. I had to just take a lost on my money, after rescheduling FOUR times. Since greyhound does not do refunds.

(I’ve also had other weird anxiety/panic attacks like when I get left home alone (as I have roommates I used to LOVE having a free house for the weekend) now I always think I might come down with a medical issue, and no one will be there to help or dial 911. It’s horrible I felt like running from the damn house but I have no where to go.

Could this be ecstasy related, it started around the same time I took the last dose of ecstasy. All three times I was high off the EX I was listening to music the whole time. My last ecstasy trip was also kinda weird, I don’t want to say it was “bad” since you can’t have a bad trip off ecstasy. Might have been laced though, I literally felt the comedown (my teeth unclenching almost instantly, I became antisocial right when the comedown started, I was irritated.) 

The day after was when the anxiety started. I kept pacing back and toward, I SOMEHOW had convinced myself the ecstasy had damaged some of my organs. I was cold one min, then the next would get really hot. I was tired but was afraid to sleep and die from hypothermia/overheat, even though I was no long high off the pills. I also started crying and had 911 on “speed dial” and after that day my anxiety has not gotten better..",Anxiety,Can ecstasy cause anxiety/panic attacks?,Drug and Alcohol,LD DA 1.csv
1.0,"Hey all.

Yesterday, me and a few friends decided to do shrooms. They are quite experienced, I however, am not. I had never done them before, only smoked a little bit of weed through the years. But due to my anxiety, I laid off weed for a long time.
Long story short, my trip consisted mostly of panic attacks with a few glimpses of things being okay. I had a panic attack an hour or so before I decided to do them (which is probably what contributed to it being such a bad trip.) The panic attack was triggered by multiple things happening yesterday prior to eating the shrooms. Because of my anxiety disorder, as you can imagine, I’m generally an overthinker and nervous a lot.

1.0,"Hello.
This is an annoyance that I really just wanted to get off my chest.

 and was diagnosed with minor anxiety many years ago now (due to a curious existential crises about death I conjured up). Over the course of the year it has just gotten worse, and recently the subject of alcohol has spontaneously included itself in my muddled array of anxiety episodes.

I drink on occasion, mainly the odd alcoholic ginger beer and dry beer, but only have ever gotten ""buzzed"". However, for some reason my anxiety seems to persist with the topic of alcohol and getting drunk. Maybe I'm just scared or over-thinking the experience of getting drunk? I am a light weight: kind of short and skinny, and it doesn't take a lot to get me tipsy, so I'm always wary when I'm drinking, which my anxiety also makes sure of.

How can I alleviate my anxiety over alcohol? How can I feel comfortable with drinking without worrying? Worrying is really irritating me.

I’ve always had an unhealthy relationship with food and emotional eating. Weed just makes stopping eating harder. I could be completely full right before smoking, and 1 hour later I’m looking for something else to eat. When I try to control my calories or eat healthily, it seems like I get a dopamine withdrawal from the shitty foods. Once I go off eating whatever I want, I feel better.

With weed, I only smoke for 10-15 days at a time and try to make myself quit for a couple weeks to a month after that. Recently though, I’ve found it incredibly hard to stop. I stopped for 2 days before today, and those 2 days were hell. I understand craving weed can be a normal thing for a chronic user, but I feel like I’m dependent on it to relieve anxiety.

Now it switched over to insane heart racing and shortness of breath, 10 times a day for at least a hour.  I always feel like I’m gonna have a stroke or heart attack and am scared for my life everyday. My single mom works so I’m alone in the house but I never know if I should call 911. Usually the hospital visits I had were nothing crazy, a quick Ativan and they send me home + covid so I’m not sure if the trip is worth it even. But these heart pains constantly hurt everyday and I’m fearful of something worse happening. I’ve taken lexapro at 2.5mg which helped maybe 2 hours and a 5mg on an empty stomach which made my heart race even worse to where I thought it was over. Is this feeling normal and are there any red flags or signs to know if it’ll get bad. Is it just the anxiety and no possibility of death could come from this and is there any ways to help with this? I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown thank u",Anxiety,Heart Palpitations,Drug and Alcohol,LD DA 1.csv

1.0,"My first experience with a panic attack was when I first touched weed.. which was back in Amsterdam I had an edible (yes silly for the first time i know) and I fell asleep and woke up heart racing my brain was telling me I was dying and I had the most traumatic experience screaming shouting convinced I was dying with my ex boyfriend.. this was around 4 years ago and I then had my grandad die which led to more panic attacks and I had to have therapy for it as I didn't know anything about panic attacks back then.

So I very much understand the feeling now and how to handle them but after last night I feel kinda back to square one.. i decided to try smoke weed as I'm stressed out at the minute and just wanted to ease it off and relax and thought I could handle it alot better now I've had therapy for it..  so I smoked some in a field with my sister not even a full spliff and I felt fine, on the walk back I started to feel weird and everything she was saying was slowed down proper bad and longed words out and my heart starting racing to fuck, i could feel the panic coming on as I didn't like how my body was feeling and I could feel my heart way too much it was like an out of body experience and I couldn't cope with it so i even said to her ""I'm about to have a panic attack"" and then I just lost my mind and I guess the adrenaline kicked in and i cant remember much and I had major intrusive thoughts that I couldn't control telling me I need to let everyone know I'm dying to save me from dying otherwise I will die because I'm dying right now and i was paranoid because everything she said i linked it to her saying it because i was dying .. so I was screaming and shouting it was extremely traumatic  I was completely disorientated confused and just felt out of this fucking world.. 

Now the day after I feel like im hungover and full of anxious thoughts, is this just a normal panic attack and the after effects? What is everyone else's experience with panic?

I have been using alcohol to help with stress/anxiety for a while now, but I would say late 2019 was when it started to get worse. I started off with only drinking a little bit or just enough to get a buzz. I would often do this so I could relax and focus on getting more shit done after being on campus all day. After doing this for a while, I feel like I need to drink until I am very drunk just to get everything off of my mind. I feel like I’ve been relying on alcohol so much. I have completed school projects/essays/etc at home completely drunk. I’ve even felt the need to get a little bit drunk just to talk to people. I did stop drinking for about 2 months and it was hard, but I was doing a little better. I ended up breaking that because I got super stressed about something and now I feel like I’m quickly falling back into my old drinking habits.

I honestly don’t know where to turn, so here I am. 

2 months ago, I met up with the random girl. 
We did some drugs (coke), and fooled around. 
70% of the encounter was her playing with me. 
When I was taking a turn at her, I rubbed the tip of my dick around her pussy, but did not put it in. Then I fingered her, and we went back to me where I finished up in her mouth. 

Now I am convincing myself she could get pregnant, and she has ghosted me 110%. 

I do believe anxiety plays a big part in this. But I can’t even talk to her to try and calm this. So I can only assume the worst. 

Apparently peeing helps clear sperm. I don’t know when I ejaculated last before this meeting, but I do know I was busy the entire day and not ejaculating; and peeing through out the day. 

To sum it up, my concern is, whatever precum that may have been on my dick, got rubbed around her pussy a bit and then possibly fingered inside her. 

Also, factors on my end that should help me in this case is I’m probably considered over weight. I smoke a pack a day. I drink a 40 of moonshine (or more) a month and do 0.5-2g of cocaine a month and smoke marijuana daily.

Also if pulling out is 95+% effective during penetrative sex, then how could rubbing genitals even prompt any worry at all.

I have social anxiety(i think).

When im supposed to met new people my heart starts pumpin and my hands begin to sweet.

When i wake up and drink coffee or just hang out with my parents i feel constant (altho mild) discomfort

-coffe makes it worse so i try to avoid it-

Sometimes i get self conscious while im talking (as if im listening to myself speaking) so i lose my train of thoughts and just feel mad,sad and annoyed cuz of that.

When i smoke weed i start tripping how all my friends are fucking around with me and its hard for me to relax.

Im not the best at eye contact because i feel like im actually not looking at people but rather i try to see myself through them. Basically I'm trying to monitor my behaviour through their responses and  their perspective of me in that moment,as if their eyes are some kind of mirror. So then i feel that i just can't go back to the unconscious/natural eye contact.

I have worked on all of this problems lately tho.

I realised that my perspective is wrong and that my friends or any people around are NOT judging me and whenever i get that feeling now this kind of logic serves me a shiled and im able to feel okay. It reminds me that im totally fine.

I started working out very strictly which makes me feel good about myself and helps a lot with internal discipline and mindfulness/calmness.

Still it ain't perfect as sometimes it just hits and i cant determine why is it so.

I never had a panic attack, dizziness or anything that severe and for that im really grateful. I see many people here that suffer a lot more then i do and that makes me wanna fight even more.

Advice that i could give right now is...
!!Do not overthink!!- you heard it a million times so i will just explain what that means to me.

You are okay... whatever you will say will be fine!!! Do not try to find the perfect answer, anything you say is good.(Bad advice if you are in quiz or in police station)

I think what fucks us all the most is trying to say to behave and carry our burdens like a god damn superman.

Fear of failure,shame, fear being judged... all those fears come from somekind if LIE/s in us that we carried and breed for so long!! Someting that is not the truth yet something we believe in. It is something irrational and untrue so there no need to bend ourselves to the plain lies. Remember them as lies.
Defend yourself (specially from yourself) like you would defend those you love and care the most. Remember that those people love you maybe even more than you love them and they would support you through anything.. Respect the belief they have in you and love they carry for you and through that you SHALL RESPECT them and you. Let that give you strength whenever new challenging situations arrive. Through that you will be able to have self positive  talk -""i can do this""etc.- Those words won't be  just words anymore because they will have deep meaning and strong foundations that will keep you from your personal ""Grìma Wormtongue"".

Yes I’m aware I am coming here first, but let me explain. I’m getting worried I have lung cancer. 

I have severe anxiety that is relatively uncontrolled, so I have been smoking weed consistently out of a bong for 3 years now, daily. Used to work 5 days a week but since March I’ve smoked almost all day everyday for on average 5 days a week, again out of a bong. 

Recently, my chest has felt more tight when it comes to breathing so getting a deep breathe in means taking a sip of water and clearing my throat or coughing some mucus out, then I can get a full deep breathe in. Sometimes the mucus I cough up is orange/brown. I figure it’s from the dirty bacteria in my bong, so again, worrisome. 

Today my right shoulder is hurting a bit/feeling sore. My neck feels more tignt as well, swallowing I don’t notice much. I have a good cough *when* I am smoking but not much after, it I cough after it’s because I’m anxious and am trying to cough up mucus to feel like I have a clear throat. 

To note again, I do have severe anxiety that has been ramped up ever since this fall, and particularly the last month or so. So idk if this is side effects of massive stress and anxiety. 

So yes, I’m posting to Reddit and not calling my doctor. I’d frankly rather have a feel out with random redditors to prepare myself for a call like this so I hope people are able to help, thanks for your time and effort",Anxiety,Need some help reasoning about potentially having lung cancer before calling a doctor.,Drug and Alcohol,LD DA 1.csv

I have had a few minutes of peace over this weekend, but they haven't lasted more than a few minutes, usually just after I wake up.

I'm seriously worried about my health. I'm 36, I've been a heavy drinker since I turned 21, and used chewing tobacco that entire time as well. I have also actively avoided going to a doctor that entire time, and I feel like it has finally caught up to me.

I'm worried that most of it is in my head and the doctor is not going to be able to help, or worse be angry with me wasting their time. I'm worried that I have cancer everywhere, and they'll have to start cutting parts out of me immediately.

I hope this is in the right place, but I really need some advice.

I have had moderate to severe anxiety for years now, something I can normally deal with just fine (granted I do smoke weed daily for this, and it helps. Much harder to keep myself together if I haven't smoked in a while)

But increasingly I have HUGE panic attacks when I have to make a decision, especially between two options where I know I should pick the one for whatever reason but personally I would prefer picking the other.
(EG stay at home or go to a family event I'm not super keen on. Many other decisions as well, this is just the one I thought of now) 

Then when I force myself to pick an option, usually the ""responsible"" option, I think I'm fine with it but the anxiety and the NEED to make a choice returns, like I have to justify my choice almost every 10 minutes to myself.

It has gotten to the point where if I have anxiety over a decision I will freak out no matter what I choose in any given situation.

1.0,"Five years ago I began to notice that I was beginning to lose control of my moods. This caused a noticeable rift in my marriage and I was determined to nip it in the bud. A doctor put me on Prozac and Xanax and sent me on my way. The Xanax was slowly increased while my tolerance grew. The doctor didn’t think twice about increasing my dose. 2 years on that regiment disaster struck. We lose a beloved pet and a day later my wife had a still birth. 

This tragedy coincided with a change in workplace. New workplace, new insurance. The new doctors wouldn’t prescribe me Xanax and drastically decreased the amount of Prozac I was on. My mood swings, depression and anxiety were at a lifetime high. I turned to alcohol to bridge the gap a lack of Xanax had made. It only made things worse. I began to steal from work to afford black market prescriptions and alcohol binges. Eventually that caught up with me and I was fired. 

Another new job and a raging addiction. It was a matter of months before I moved to hard drugs. In the time that followed I almost died a dozen times. I was arrested, committed, tried to stop, failed every time, and lost another job. My depression was all consuming. It contaminated every memory, every thought, every action. Panic was my baseline mood. I was at bottom with no light in sight. 

I checked into rehab. Therapy 12 hours a day. Daily visits with the doctor. For the first time someone played with my medication. I failed again and again. Relapsing every time a new antidepressant failed to work. I was on the brink of losing my home, my wife, and my daughter. Four different antidepressants later and I was convinced the only option was for me to succumb to my addiction and to let it kill me. 

That was almost a year ago. My last attempt at finding hope laid with a nurse practitioner. 13 different non narcotic anti anxiety medications. 7 antidepressants later. More relapses than I could count and I began to see it. Hope. Slowly I began to feel a little better. I began waking with less and less weight on my mind. My hands ever so slightly taking hold of the wheel. The nurse continued to push, finding just the right cocktail of Medication, therapy, and behavior I needed to keep chipping away. 

Two weeks ago after a five year journey through the darkest part of my life I began to wake up with positivity, with optimism. It no longer felt like I was in line waiting for my life to begin. And the feeling has begun to increase at a rate I never thought was possible. For what feels like the first time in my life I feel like I have control. 

I am not telling this story to brag. I share this for anyone out there who feels like giving up. Who sees no light at the end of their tunnel and would like nothing more to shrivel up into nothingness. I remember being there. The hopelessness, the darkness, the weight of your mind. I remember being an abused passenger of my own thoughts and fears.  I remember being overwhelmed. I remember hating myself more then my worst enemy. But after all that I am alive. And for the first time I am seeing light. My journey is by no means complete and dark days are waiting for me around every corner. But I feel like I am ready to face them.

1.0,"  Hey. I’ve been for the last 6 months struggling but successfully getting tapered off benzodiazepines. I have had a couple relapse but got myself all the way back to where I was before each time and I have never been this low of a dose. I’m almost finished. Another 6 month-year to fully recover.

  I’ve been off and on addicted to different drugs throughout my life since I was 16.  I had a good amount of time when I was sober for several years.  Other drugs I started using again during one of my most recent relapses is heroin which I haven’t been around in over 4 years. Haven’t touched an opiate in 4 years. I don’t know what triggered it. But I was dabbling in other stuff just before like cocaine and ketamine and quit those and had intense cravings.

  Anyways, quitting so many things at once led me to saying fuck it and I did heroin for a month. Long enough to of course have to go through physical withdrawal again.. some days I feel like such a loser. I’ve asked old friends (moved back to my old city temporarily) for stuff and they’ve all talked to me pretty rudely said they were clean and to stay away from them. I thought they all were doing the same stuff.  I guess I was wrong..  I left the area I was living just recently cuz my roommates couldn’t handle my benzo detox anymore. Well one of them couldn’t. I live with my boyfriend and his mom and my boyfriend was really supportive but his mom was treating me really bad. I started staying in my room and not coming out at all for like 10 days until my family came to pick me up.

  I guess what started my relapsing into benzos was they were prescribed by my dentist for my back to back appointments and then I got hooked, I finally felt normal. I felt calm and like I could work with society. They led me to really getting hooked and getting them from friends in the area. And I have now been on them for a year, this coming January. I’ve been tapering the last 4-6 months and I’ve come a long way. But now I’ve got to face opiate withdrawal along with benzo withdrawal and I’m just really saddened that I’m in this kind of position again. It makes me cry writing these couple sentences right now. I can’t believe I’m here again.

  I had an art business I was building. I’m an oil painter and I had commissions to do. I didn’t finish any of them and they paid me. I feel like such shit about it. But I’m took sick everyday to even think of painting. My art business was slowly building after 3 years of hard work every single day I started getting 500$ commissions coming in monthly and my stickers and prints sold pretty quickly. I was going somewhere. 

The trigger was leaving a very abusive relationship with a narcissist. I couldn’t cope with the loss and I started taking more and more Xanax. And I felt normal and I just kept doing that.

  Idk what is in store now. My memory is shot from the pills, I can’t drive myself safely from the medications I’m on, I feel like everyone hates me ( I think it’s mostly in my head although I’ve had people treat me poorly) and I’ve lost my brain and stability temporarily for maybe the next year. I can’t sleep regular. I wake up at 5-8pm and my day starts then so my sleep is backwards. That makes me feel really depressed. 

  Can I turn my life around again? I don’t see many ways except keep going with getting off the meds and face the opiate withdrawal again. I tried once it was awful. Worse than I remember before and last time I was on them over a year daily.  Can I really make it again? I’m 25 and I feel like the clock is ticking and I’m losing so much time I could be building my life. 

  I wanna be successful I wanna build my art business again. Is that even possible again? I feel at a dead end. I don’t know who I am now. Idk what I want. I don’t know what to do. I can’t work I can’t drive. I’m literally forced to do nothing because of benzo withdrawal. I wish I could go back. I wish I could make a change. I feel really helpless at times. I think about ending my life multiple times in a week now for the last year. Can my life return to normal? I don’t know.. I just feel so alone.

Here’s some info if you’re not familiar with benzo detox and withdrawal here’s a very great way to understand it I’ve sent this article to friends and family when they have treated me poorly for my lack of ability to do things day to day: https://w-bad.org/family-and-friends-this-ones-for-you/",depression,Everyday I wake up I see no road ahead of me.,Drug and Alcohol,LD DA 1.csv

1.0,"Hello everyone,

I am a 26 year old guy going through a tough time. I have a weak physique and have abused substances for the last 7 years. I smoked a lot, drank a lot and smoked up. . In my head since I had faked it all but hadn't realised. By this I mean that I had just buried many incidents and wasn't aware of it in my waking life. The odd thing is that since we were suffering financially I had to act strong and tough which I did. I acted like an adult but when I did become an adult I acted like a child. This created serious problems in my college life. I noticed at the end of it that I had become hurtful and disrespectful to others since there was deep pain inside which I had never dealt with. 

Now things aren't interesting anymore. Nothing interests me, because of the substance abuse I have hurt my body a lot. I have pain all throughout my body and have also gone through a mild phase of PIED, or something similar. I have crazy image issues because of something that happened multiple times over my school life. This created such issues that even when women wanted to talk I would just run away. Now I feel bad for myself on a daily basis but I am trying. 

I don't have anyone to talk to. And the ones i had i have blocked them all because it has become hard to trust anyone. I once wrote about the abuse in a set of few pages and i left the pages in a person's house and then of course they were leaked. Just before that i was in this metro city where i became quite lonely and used to frequent sex workers, all my vices and ""sins"" were leaked and i was harrassed on an unprecedented level. A college official used to come to my hostel and talk to my hostel mates right below my window. There were noises everywhere, and I somehow managed through it using my anger. Now those nights just haunt me because sometimes I feel till when. I get it I might have messed up my college life, but what about my childhood, i didn't really have control over what was being done. 

And it is my childhood that ruined my college life. I find it all too funny now. Life is just a good joke. Bmi really want to leave my country and go to someplace where no one knows me.",depression,"Depressed and lonely, been like that for 23 years of my life",drug and alcohol,LD DA 1.csv

I have no job. My mother does drugs with me and she ends up paying all my drug debts. Then her boyfriend comes on the weekend and he pays for all the drugs, the cycle never ends. Then I'm ticking/borrowing drugs and racking up debts. When I'm sober, my bipolar is out of control. The mania is insane. I'm on fluoxetine. I'm not professionally diagnosed, I've waiting for the psychiatric to diagnosis me. Self diagnosing is not good. But the doctor even says I am and has booked the referral. But because of the fluoxetine, I'm getting extremely manic. My eyes get so dilated. Like today, I had to get rid of my cat, because it kept shitting in my room. Which it never use to do. I took it to a rescue place. I was so manic. I was singing to my cat. Driving without a care. Then when I said my goodbyes. I put some music on and start doing manic rapping like a completely unhinged person. Then I got home, listened to podcasts. WAS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE. The manic was gone. I was lying face down on my bed. Listening to the Magnus Archives. Then I speak to my mom and I get drugs. We do them. I'm in and out driving back and forth to my dealer. Getting drugs, doing them in the kitchen. Driving coked off my head back and forth. Now I'm sitting here typing this. My mom is paying one of my dealers debts off this Friday coming. I feel like such a shit person, I'm wrecking mine and my mothers life. She is a addict and so am I. I take my little brother to school and I'm not the nicest of people. He suffers with autism and adhd and I lose my temper, to the point I have to make him sit in the backseat and I have to wear eardefenders because he touches everything and says all things to make me tick. It's just a endless cycle. It all went down south ever since I met cocaine and lost my job because I got drug tested. Ever since that I'm just a miserable piece of shit. I'm 24 years old, receding hairline i weigh 220 pounds because I constantly binge eat. I'm a shell of a person and if I did have the courage to kill myself. I would of definitely done it by now and you wouldn't be reading this. I've tried walking through parks, abandoned exploration, seeing sights, I recently got a dog. Soon I plan to take her for walks, when she's old enough. (She's a puppy.) All my family know I'm a unhinged bomb which could explode any minute. My mom does everything for me, I could atleast treat her better. But mental health runs through my family. It's like nothing gets through to each and one of us. I have a auntie who is a narc and I use to live with my aunt and grandmother, she forced me to get credit cards and I don't even live with her now. I live with my mom. She uses my credit cards. I've never used the fucking card once. She's brought sofas and fucking god knows what else. But she does pay it off. But that's not the point. I had a argument with her the other day saying I want the cards payed and you to fuck off out my life. My auntie took everything off her mom. Her home. Everything she ever worked for. But that's another story.

I think about just slicing my arm sometimes, deeply just not thinking about it and just thrushing it straight through. I'll probably call the ambulance because then I would realise I don't want to die. But these thoughts come and go. Sometimes I just want to yank my steering wheel into a lamppost. Not another driver that would be selfish. But the lamppost can be fixed surely. Sometimes I just want to go to a store where you buy all materials, doors and kitchen appliances. Just buy a rope and Google how to make a slipknot, buy a bottle of vodka, take all my antidepressants. Obviously before setting up the rope. Once I've taken all them tabs, down that vodka furiously. I know I'm going to die then. So just fucking jump on that rope and end this nightmare. 

That paragraph are my constant thoughts. I've self harmed before. But never majorly. I headbutted a glass panel through before. That was probably the worst thing I done. I drank a whole bottle of bacardi. Boosh! Head through this glass panel. Ear hanging off and head split open. Glass in my head. I even rung a fucking taxi. You should of seen the taxi drivers reaction. Like me casually asking him to take me to the hospital. I pay him the fair. Arrive at the hospital. Blood dripping all down me. I don't even have to book myself in, or sit down and wait. (This was near beginning corona). The nurse took me straight in. I was highly intoxicated and was sarcastically making jokes about what happened. I said someone bottled me because I didn't want to admit I done such a thing. They stitched me up, I have a scar now I'm just forehead and my hair is usually shaved. So it's noticeable. I got sent home. I had no money I paid a random guy to take me home. Got home. Took off my bandage and popped open a beer. 

This is all purely venting, I clearly don't want to die. But I feel like I'm slowly reaching the inevitably of actually doing what my mind is telling me to do.

1.0,"I’ve been seeing one specific psychiatrist for the past 6 months, initially meeting monthly, but just recently once every 2 months. I’m currently prescribed 300mg Buprion XL daily for depression. Originally I was taking Sertraline, but that was changed at my first initial visit.  As expected, he asked about my recreational drug use, I mentioned that I smoke marijuana daily and drink alcohol 2-3 times per week. (Sometimes in excess, sometimes not) He asked me other typical questions, what the substance use does for me, why I use it, why I don’t want to stop using, etc. He was very focused on alcohol use (as I have alcoholism present on both sides of my family) which is 100% understandable.
I see a therapist bi-weekly within the same practice, so over the past few months I’ve been working hard on improving myself, but obviously healing is not linear. Most days I am feeling better, but things are not PERFECT. Just yesterday I had a phone visit with my psych to discuss how I’ve been doing. Told him I’ve been doing well, no issues with medications, and I’m feeling positive. He asked me about my drinking, I let him know I drink 2 days per week maximum, but I have been charting/keeping track of what I drink for my own personal insight (per recommendation of my weekly therapist) and it’s been helping me from excessive consumption. 
His response to me was that it sounds like I am still not taking treatment seriously, and starting next visit I will be required to provide a urine sample for drug testing each time. From what I’ve been reading, it makes sense for a psychiatrist to do initial/random drug testing, but my situation seems out of the ordinary? Does he see something with my progress that I don’t, or does he think I’m lying or I’m not taking my medication? Aren’t urine tests not typically helpful with alcohol use? I was very thrown off by this meeting, and I’m hesitant to schedule the next meeting. I want to clarify that I am NOT afraid of providing a urine test nor would I refuse it when asked of me, but I am asking for an opinion given my situation, as I feel it may not be normal.

1.0,"For some reason tonight I've been overwhelmed with the feeling of finally WANTing to make changes to better my health - both physically and mentally. (The physical aspects of my health that I need to better generate anxiety that can lead to spiraling overthinking patterns and often a heavy sense of hopelessness.) I want to take advantage of this feeling tonight, and finally set my foot down to better myself once and for all.

Having generalized anxiety, BPD and depression on top of ADD and an unclear reason as to why I can't seem to commit 100% to things (probably mostly due to my depression and my suppressing habits) makes it bad a combo for when I try to set my mind to any type of goal. Whether it's improving my art, going back to school, dental hygiene, lung care and so on, there's really one thing that I want to tackle right before I get into those cases; alcohol and nicotine. 

I guess my question is what can I do to help me stay positive towards achieving my goals, when often getting discouraged, agitated, hopeless (etc) gets me craving what soothes me so temporarily yet causes a huge list of complications.  It sounds silly, but hearing the simplest answers from someone else might help a bit more than just the thinking I do in my head, at least its what I'm trying to test by posting on here for the first time!

I have a horrible experience with doctors and medications (always feels like they're just trying to give me pills so I can get out), and I can't afford to pay for a professional psychologist right now, as I'm about to be between jobs. I used to self-medicate with alcohol / weed, but I don't / can't use either anymore because of health conditions that emerged after a couple years of drinking way too much.

I really need to learn to handle my own emotions and manage this so that I don't put unreasonable or unfair weight on the people that I care about. Whenever I can't talk to the people that I ""need"" to talk to, my anxiety takes hold and it's hard to not act manipulative. I don't *want* to manipulate anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone. But, it feels like everything I think of doing to process these things with others is manipulative and toxic without me realizing it at first.

Then I get into this loop where I realize that everything that I *want* to do is, in reality, selfish and harmful to the people that I care about the most. And that is the *single thing that I absolutely never, ever, want to do*. It's like I've become the one thing that I swore to never be. And I don't think that I actually *am* that, but I still don't want people to think that's me, or that I'm doing it on purpose. I don't want to do it at all. Ever.

It's been years since I was truly depressed / suicidal, and I'm honestly scared shitless of falling down that rabbit hole again.

So, if anyone has some support, techniques, tools, or advice for how a grown-ass man can finally learn to process his own emotions without inadvertently hurting other people, it would be much appreciated.",mentalhealth,I can't trust myself to not be a toxic person,Drug and Alcohol,LD DA 1.csv
1.0,"To not throw away what I've gained in the last two years I am writing this. Other reasons are to share this with other people who can give me other perspectives other then the people who helped me thus far and are already concerned with me.

It took me two years with my last psychotic episode last summer to feel finally somewhat recovered. Treatment was hard on me and my loved ones. But mostly on me, because I feel I had permanent changes in the way I experienced life itself.

What isn't unimportant to know is the main cause of my psychotic episodes were drug use. In my teens I started drinking, smoking cigarettes and marijuana. After turning 18 until the age of 25 I increasingly abused different types of stimulants, cathinones, amphetamines, but not cocaine. Also MDMA and other research chemicals. Several types of dissociatives, benzodiazepines and a few psychedelics.

It caused me several experiences which were traumatic, but I brushed them off and kept using. Several times I came close to death or so it felt because of tachycardia and overheating.

I smoked marijuana almost every day, but I kept drinking at a minimum since I thought of it as an inferior drug.

At 26 I went psychotic and got committed to a psych ward for several weeks. I never felt so frightened in my life. Not even close to the times I went overboard, although it was comparable to the times I got bad trips from psilocybin mushrooms.

They forced me to take haloperidol and I recovered, not that it healed me, it just got me out of my psychosis. The next day, I went back to smoking marijuana and it caused something I never felt before as in my senses were completely overwhelmed and it felt wrong.
I kept taking the medication for a week and wanted to get off later. After talking to a family member about it, I stayed on.

The haloperidol made me so miserable, I had no emotions on it and felt like a faded image of my old self. I do not even want to remember it felt, it caused me extreme aversion with everything that has to do with psychiatry.
It was just horrible.

To mitigate the depressive feelings I started smoking marijuana again. Until... I became psychotic again, got committed again and put on haloperidol again. This time as a long lasting injection. Again, I couldn't function as a human being. I felt mentally handicapped.

My parent who emigrated told me to go to their country a year and try to recover there, to be away from marijuana.
My loved one with who I am with since a few years also lives there. I went to live with her and her parents.

It was a great decision, but after two months being there I went into psychosis again. This time without consuming anything. The psychiatrist, who had other views as the ones that helped me in my country, told me it was of abstinence. Or withdrawal.

I got committed to a hospital, which was better for me. I absolutely hate psych wards and can't stand the people there as I have my own problems to deal with. They put my on Clorpromazine and antihistamines, which dulled my psychosis and made me able to go home.

Later they added alprazolam to manage my anxiety. I later suspended with guidance of the psychiatrist the antipsychotics but kept taking alprazolam. I found the alprazolam also enjoyable. I knew it was extremely addictive, but since it was part of the treatment I kept taking it. I vaped enormous amounts of nicotine during treatment to not be drowsy all day.

When I found it was time to quit the alprazolam it took me a few months to quit, by decreasing the dose each time. I went from 2mg by decreasing 0.25 each week. It was torture, because loud sounds made me completely stressed out. I couldn't handle hearing any music. My sleeping pattern was very regular.

After quitting, I improved but something was still off. For months I didn't have any issues until may where I became psychotic again and got committed to the same hospital. Same treatment, but without alprazolam, instead they gave me carbamazepine. An antiepileptic drug which acts as a moodstabilizer. The argument was it would control the erratic activity in my brain they saw in the EEG scan the first time (third psychosis).

After finishing that treatment, I had to keep taking carbamazepine, but I didn't like how it made me feel. My greatest wish since day 1 which was four years ago is to feel normal and carefree.

Things are going great now, I am recovering at a very fast pace, noticing changes in my way of thinking. No longer feeling like a debilitated victim of my own mind. The traumas are slowly disappearing and I am accepting my past as it was. Trying to not blame myself.

This I am grateful for, but it was not thanks to a psychologist since I never got one. The strange thing is, since I am trying to become normal again and undertake activities that benefit me I have started to drink alcohol.

This is what bothers me and is a dilemma. I am trying to get myself back on my feet economically and also trying to feel like I can be outgoing again and enjoy things I felt deprived of for the last few years.

I do not want to live trying to be too strict which I know which will cause me to feel guilty when I do slip up.
Or when I do try to go out and have a drink get myself in situations which are dangerous.

However, there have already occured several things which are bothersome, which confirm my thoughts written above. 

The lack of experience drinking all those years while thinking I can handle the same amount of alcohol as I could before has caused me the following;

I took several alprazolam over the course of a day. Lost control of myself and I went out to get a beer, the first drink in years. After that one beer my memory was gone, I got home, went in coma for two days and severely scared my loved ones. I also insulted them verbally while under the influence. Something that is not natural to me.

After talking with them they told me it was better to just have a drink in moderation, instead of doing it like this.
I felt ashamed for several days and thought about what they said.

I drank a few times after that. One time it was raining and asked my loved one to help me get my moped to a dry spot, which triggered the alarm and got me yelling. My loved one thought I was yelling at her. I apologised, told her it was not directed at her and understood it made her look and feel bad.

The third time it went wrong I went to a party, after that went drunkenly on my moped with a friend to a bar to keep drinking beer. Even though it was in the countryside with no cars it was extremely irresponsible. My loved one kept calling me, but I didn't pick up. She went there at 5 am and I got angry at her, yelled at her and we went home.

The next day I apologised to her and after to her parents, which they accepted. I've lived with hem the last two years and they know how I normally am. I told my loved one the amount of trauma and anger I was carrying, because of what happened to me the last few years.

At Christmas Eve, I got drunk again. This time nothing happened, I had fun, I danced with my loved one, we laughed. She wanted to go to bed early, but I wanted to stay up some more. Eventually we went to bed at 11pm.

The next day we barely celebrated Christmas, because that isn't such a tradition here. In the evening I drank something with her father, got inebriated but not drunk. She asked me not to keep drinking, but I did.

At night, she did not like that I did not listen to her and I promised to stop whenever she says she thinks I had enough.

Typing this out, it sounds like I am either a horrible abusive person, somebody staving off to be an alcoholic, or any other negative thing you can imagine especially since my history with drug abuse.

I am very aware of that, I am also aware of the sensitive state I am in. I have found out I have anger issues which I do not express when sober, but I do feel.

However, I feel like I am finding a balance in trying to not deprive myself and not overdoing it. And I keep messing up. Now I am in a somewhat protected environment with people caring about me, but what if it goes wrong when I am by myself?

Or what if I am too harsh on myself and have to accept that I can make mistakes and people can forgive me, as long as I don't keep breaking their trust. Just like I had broken the trust of so many people by being always drugged-out.

This not meaning I take advantage of the trust my loved ones have in me. Since they were by my side the last two years. They are not telling me to not drink at all, but do it in moderation. I need advice on this, but I don't want to be asking them this either.

Honestly, I want to keep drinking but not at the expense of others. I want to be able to trust myself with a few drinks.",mentalhealth,"Recovering from psychosis, but afraid of messing up.",Drug and Alcohol,LD DA 1.csv

Lately I've been feeling very confused with my place in this world, what I want to do in the future and who I really am. I've been in my head a lot and have had so many ups and downs in the last year and a half. Its just crazy how so much has changed recently in my life and I'm kinda freestyling life now.

 Prior to this, at 14-15, I started dabbling with alcohol, weed, other stuff (anything I could get my hands on). Graduated to trying other drugs and did a bit too much LSD for a short period of time (like a month). Kinda hate it now lol. And now I haven't done much drugs and I feel so empty. It might sound a bit stupid (considering I never did so much drugs that I was addicted or nothing) but I always feel the urge to do some type of drug just to feel different and I feel like the potential for a drug problem is developing (if that makes sense). Now you may be thinking why even mention this, well I don't know if my minor drug use is affecting my feelings of not really knowing who I am anymore.

I had a beautiful life in 2014-2016. The best time of my entire life. I drank carefully then, I had my wonderful boyfriend who was deeply in love with me, I had so many cool friends, I was going to school and was around people who were into the same stuff as me all the time. I had an easy but high paying job with coworkers I loved.
I was basically okay, but I struggled a bit in school with long term planning and organization. I couldn't finish the final project, so I decided to call a psychiatrist. He gave me lithium, and it worked at first but then after a month it began to slowly give me psychosis but I didn't know what was happening to me until I had a full blown meltdown and got rid of all my furniture and thought I was eating bugs. I stopped eating and started drinking every day, so my dad told me to move back home. 
I slept for a year and survived on alcohol and slim fast. I didn't want to die yet but I was bad off. My dad bought me booze and gave me opioids to help me cope. Did not help. 
I got addicted. 

In 2019, I had finally started to feel normal again. Then covid hit in 2020 and the past years isolating were added to the isolation of this year but worse.
When I speak to anyone, my brain turns to a pile of psychedelic goo and it's difficult to tell where I end and they begin and I feel really creepy. I just feel like I come off as basically cool but I make myself very nervous because I don't know if I'll be stable tomorrow. I'm exhausted from going up and down and feeling like I'm lost in this weird soup. It's hard to explain so don't worry if it sounds too esoteric.
I don't think I have gotten the best diagnosis yet, because on antipsychotics I thought better. It was easier to think clearly, and I read and wrote and understood more better. I'm smart, but didn't know it because I had some kind of thing that made it hard for me to learn as well as others it seemed like. 
But I know now that I'm smart, and love to learn, and now I feel like I'm trying to walk on a broken leg when I try to read. It's the most depressing thing to feel like the person you love is trapped inside of you, trapped by mental illness. 
I just want to get the hell out of this prison. 

I don't think it's that sad in my case. 
I do love to sing, and I will feel guilty for ending the song inside my heart so to speak. 
But the things I love about myself make me angry. It makes me angry that this beautiful person I've always wanted to be and deserved to be is trapped in this fucking defective meat sack. 
Maybe I do need to be grateful for what I do have. Maybe I need to be okay with the quality of life I'm capable of, even if it's not very good.

I've spent 2 weeks alone in my room, only going out to grab my daily fifth of vodka. Yesterday it all hit me that I'm so broke now I cant even afford my liquor that I decided to stop.  I don't have any idea how im going to pay my rent, and im too scared to call my boss and beg for my job back. So now I'm alone in this dark room on christmas eve because even my family is done with me.

I just want to die, so badly. I feel like this constant feeling I've had for years will never go away. I've been to therapy, rehab, psych hospitals. I survived near death and it changed nothing.

1.0,"Just some background, I've been dealing with a horrible depression since high-school (24 now) and I've tried everything to get rid of it. I've been in good shape, I've improved my diet, I've improved my sleep schedule and while these things did definitely help, nothing got me quite over the Hump. I still felt depressed, moody, unmotivated in social life and in school. For the past year I started taking antidepressants, and eventually I got all the way up to the highest dosage (200mg), and while this made more functional and generally more apathetic to the bad feelings (and rhe good ones too), I still wasn't content. All it did was reduce my capacity to feel anything and I dont want that kind of life tho it was an improvement over my life previously where my mind constantly tortured itself. So anyways somebody gave me shrooms and when I did that, i noticed a weird shift in my mood. I did low doses for awhile but I felt a lot more ""in the moment"" i didn't feel like a zombie dragging his feet barely receptive to the stimulus around me, I felt way more engaged for once. Anyways I took low doses for awhile, and the I decided to take a much bigger one and that has made things even better. I feel so much more resilient, Its been so much easier to lose weight which I had gained so much from being on antidepressants and I just feel more in the moment and content.

Now I won't say that its fixed everything, I still have stuff to work on but to those of you who are struggling with depressions, I would definitely recommend if you can.

If this option isn't available to you, I've found a few things that markedly improved my functionality in dealing with my pretty severe depression. 

1. Spinach. Just wilt it in a pan, even a little would do, and eat it with meat or whatever to get it down. Its practically medicine, I definitely a bigger pep in my step when I have ate some spinach. Add other vegetables to for even better effects here.

2. Antidepressants. If you were like me and can barely get out of bed, I recommend getting antidepressants (i took 200mg of sertraline). While it does just make you apathetic, I felt so much more able to accomplish what I needed and made sleeping a lot more easier to do when anxiety isn't so present. 

1+2 together can make a very significant change in life. 

3. Stand with your back straight, neck more aligned and not haunched over. This does a bit to help you think I've found. There have been studies on it and id recommend looking into this particularly if you need help socializing.

It’ll probably help to check my post history quickly, but basically in recent weeks/months I’ve been feeling horrible guilt over ways I’ve acted and things I’ve done when I was younger as a teenager. I’ve posted about them here, spoke to my mum etc, but it just stays in my head and I can’t get rid of it.

Anyway, I hope people here might understand, that when you’re an anxious person things just seem to stick in your head more and are harder to move past, things such as guilt etc. Obviously, guilt is warranted in these circumstances, but it’s really plaguing me and stopping me from moving on and becoming a better person. I have an assessment and CBT booked for this and other reasons in the new year, but I was wondering if anyone else who struggles with anxious thoughts (I don’t want to say anxiety as I’m not officially diagnosed) and has felt this sort of guilt in the past could give me advice for moving past it in a constructive way, not necessarily forgetting it, but just allowing myself to actually focus on some other things.

TRIGGER WARNING: Gaslighting, Abuse, Self harm, Panic attacks.‼️‼️

Starting all the way from the begining.. In my first years of middle school I was super shy, I would barely talk, I didn’t think much of it and no one else did either. Then things like panic attacks and fear of judgement started creeping in. In class before a presentation or even just answering would make me shake uncontrollably, my teeth would click together. 
It was so bad that even my classmates would notice, it was super embarrassing. 

One time when I was telling a poem in front of the class, because that’s what schools make you do, my legs were so weak that after I finished it I crumbled to the ground, the teacher was kind of patient with me but still gave me a bad mark, even though it clearly wasn’t my fault. Another kid that had the same problem as me said it worse than me and got a better mark. Favoritism  I say, but I can’t blame her, the dude is so nice and likable.

An incident that I remember so vividly.. I’m sitting in class, the teacher isn’t there and everyone is talking, screaming. I keep trying to focus but I can’t. I can’t. I can’t. It physically hurt me, my neck stiffened, my eyes were about to start shedding tears, my fists were clenched deep into my hair. I wanted to scream. After a while the teacher came in and calmed everyone down, finally. 

My shaky days in school were the worst, before having to sing in front of the whole class, keep in mind I’m really bad at singing and there’s this one girl who is absolutely amazing at singing who judges everyone.. She’s sitting in the front, I  was shaking so much one girl sitting next to me looked at me funny and asked if I’m shaking. As if it wasn’t fucking obvious. The humiliation I felt was unreal.

Horribly there were even a panic attacks induced by simple texts. The girl who was in my previous mini story texted me, telling me she harms herself. I tried helping but she told me, I shit you not - “stop it, you’re the reason I’m going to cut myself even more” I was crying so much, so damn much. I thought talking to her would help, she wasn’t the first person to tell me about stuff like that, I didn’t help my cousin that told me before her so I thought maybe, just maybe I could do a good deed for once and help someone?.. As you can probably tell - It didn’t go very well.

The year after all of that - everything settled down. I wasn’t as scared, my heart would still pound faster when I had to present, say “here” or do tasks as mentioned before but it was way more tame. Everything was okay, I thought I was finally improving. Little did I know things would get a million times worse, not in school but at home.

Basically every day now I have either tiny or explosive panic attacks where I can just slighty breathe. I had one just before writing this post. The root of my meltdowns is not surprisingly - family. All they ever do is scream and shout, my sisters little kid that she gave to us because she didn’t want to take care of him always cries, cries and cries, my parents yell at him and smack him, making him scream even more. Holy fuck I’m about to fucking cry again. 

I’ve noticed I’m super sensitive to screaming, when ever I hear someone yelling in anger or screaming in general it makes me want to scream louder to block out the noise. Every time things get especially bad I can’t help but start harming myself in places I later regret, crying, screaming or breaking stuff. I can’t help but think I’m weak, afterall, my sister had to go through all of this, even worse than me, being punished by my parents not only mentally but also physically.

Once my sister was getting repeatedly smacked with a broom, us having to share a room I could hear everything, I was so little, my sister even said she’d kill herself, my mother with no hesitation grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stomped back into our room, yelling for her to do it. 

I don’t know if I’m sensitive to yelling because of ptsd or something but I quite literally can’t take it. I try to calm down but the build up in my throat is too much, It hurts so much if I don’t do anything. Many, many times I’ve been told by my parents that they think I’m sick, I have a god complex, I only care about myself, I need mental help, I need to be sent to an insane asylum or what not. That shit fucking hurts since I know it’s their fault I’m the way I am. The time my mother saw my completely fucked arms, by that I mean cut up.. It was terrifying. She was screaming at me so much.. I tried jumbling up lies about what happened, I should’t have been so carefree, I should have covered them up. 

If you were wondering, no it’s not just my parents who are that horrible. It’s also my whole family line! Since my father’s half of the family is all dead I’m only going to speak about my mother’s. My grandpa has anger management issues my cousin, my mom, my aunt, even his wife, he’s too old and sickly to do anything now. My grandma has anger management issues but I guess she isn’t too bad when you’re obedient. My aunt also has anger management issues (starting to see a pattern yet?), is an extreme hypocrite, can be kinda cool but that’s only if she’s in a really good mood, if not, you’re going down into hell with her, whether you want it or not. The only chill people in my family are my cousin and my uncle, they’re cool. 

If you read all of this - thank you so much.

But then my graduating year of highschool it came back.... and it came back stronger then ever.  Around the start of 2020 just a month or two before covid became a big problem i had one panic attack in class.   And then it happened again. And again. And again.  And just from one single attack i ended up leaving school (dont worry. I ended up graduating online.)   My attacks had become way worse then anything compared to when i was younger.  It got so bad that because i constantly had a nervous stomach i stopped eating and i lost 40 pounds and became malnurished and basically looked like i was terminally ill.

I feel like my experience growing up could have easily contributed to me growing up anxious af - however - I think those experiences instead helped shape me into the resilient individual who I am today. This will be written as short and sweet as possible to convey this idea I would like to discuss. 

I grew up as a low income immigrant - I was overweight until about 14 and was constantly bullied for it in grade school and in my neighborhood - I got beat up in the neighborhood and verbally abused at school. My dad used to beat me as a child for not keeping the house clean. I also had neighborhood “friends” who embraced hip/hop and rap culture (90s rap) who constantly instilled in me that I had to be “tougher” because that’s what the music told us. Essentially - these experiences are probably not what you would recommend to someone dealing with anxiety - I could have resulted as someone being extremely anxious about people and the world. I have a lot of reasons to be upset at the world and these are just a few examples I wanted to highlight quickly. 

I don’t think you should get bullied to help develop your mental fortitude - I don’t think you should get beat by your parents to make you more resilient - I also don’t think you should embrace toxic gangster rap culture as a solution to being socially anxious. 

However - I can’t help but feel like these experiences have set me a part from my peers in a way that helps me remain resilient through tough situations. I’m not trying to say that I’m better because of these experiences, but I’m wondering if anyone else feels like their experiences could have broken their spirit but instead built them up. 

Do you feel like your experience isn’t something you would recommend to someone else dealing with anxiety but is something you identify with as helping you remain level headed in tough situations? 

TLDR: I was bullied as a kid for being overweight, I was sometimes beat by my Dad as a child, I was influenced by my environment to embrace a “tough” mentality through hip hop/rap culture.

I've recently noticed while doing some self reflection that almost the majority of my anxiety, fear and tension which is chronic at this point is manifested physically in my back, neck and shoulders.

I've had a stressful childhood and young adulthood. stress and fear have been my lifelong inseparable friends and that was just a matter of poor luck and shitty circumstance.

But now that I'm aware of all of that, I'm not much affected by the shitty circumstance... 

And was wondering if there's a quick way to get rid of the physical feeling of fear and tension in my back, it seems really silly and self imposed but I don't really know how to alleviate the fear out of my fucking back. 

I feel like if I could just get the physical feeling to go away, my mental state would get so much better... it would make the anxiety and fear more tolerable.

Does anyone have specific experience similar to mine that can share what they learned from it, and how they made things less... stressful?

My parents moved out of state to be near my brother and this was my first Christmas without them (not to mention with COVID and me being an essential worker anyway). I’ve always felt that my parents favored my brother over me. I finally broke down crying last night after my mom texted me to ask me to get on our family Zoom because my dad “accidentally forgot to text me the code.” 

I have deep issues from childhood that I need to work through. At a pretty young age (about 7), my dad started referring to me as “lazy” and “careless” anytime I didn’t want to do something he wanted me to (mainly playing sports when I wasn’t very interested in them or good at them). 

Of course, my brother was a star athlete, so he won my dad’s attention and favoritism just by playing sports. I got into a good college, got an advanced degree and work in a helping profession. I have run several long distance races while raising money for charity. I have a good husband and two shelter pets. No accomplishment makes me feel good. I still feel rejected and empty. 

I feel even more triggered right now with the holidays. I have gained about 5 lbs (I’m skinny anyway so it shouldn’t really matter), but with the weight gain I’m reliving all the times my brother called me a “fat cow” when I was an overweight child. Today, my husband wouldn’t stop criticizing my driving in the car. It brought me back to when my dad tried to teach me to drive and was so critical and made me so anxious the entire time I nearly caused an accident. I’m now angry with my husband (I still believe he was in the wrong), but I wish I wasn’t so upset. 

I grew up in a family with plenty of money and opportunities, so I often feel like my struggles aren’t valid. But here I am, almost 30 years old, resenting my family for the way they have treated me over the years. Every time I bring up how I feel, I end up crying and feel like I’m gaslit into looking like the “crazy” or “spoiled” sibling because my brother and parents usually remain calm. As a result of my life experiences and brain chemistry, I have diagnoses of anxiety, OCD, and moderate depression. The OCD is paralyzing and makes my day to day like exhausting. I don’t talk about any of it with my family. They tell me they love me and are proud of me, but it’s so hard to get past it all.

As a teenager he got into drugs and witnessed more than a kid his age should witness. As a result of all this, he has a depression, among other things, but the depression is the more severe ""side effect"" . 

During winter, his depression gets worse. It's the anniversary for a lot of his trauma, it's Christmas, and we live in a country where the sun barely shines during winter. He is trying to get help, but his doctor is lazy, so it's taking way longer than it should for him to refer my boyfriend to a psychiatrist or therapist.

He basically ruined my childhood, and I'm still scared of him. Now, I've been getting mad and ranting over really stupid stuff. Like, someone almost broke my supplies, but it was an honest mistake on their part (they were actually trying to help me), and I was able to fix them. Instead of accepting it like a logical person would, I started yelling about how upset I was. Then, after, I felt so ashamed that I got mad enough to yell over basically nothing. I didn't yell at the person who did it, but I yelled about how stupid it was to the other person in the room. I never actually do this long rant toward the person who makes me mad when this happens (probably because I'll feel bad if I see their face and that will stop me from cussing + I'm afraid of confrontation).

I struggle with pretty bad generalized and social anxiety and it’s definitely related to my childhood. I am in therapy but it hasn’t helped me figure out how to cope with the anxiety I feel around social encounters. 

What happened: Last night I was going for a walk with my roommate and a guy walking his dog stopped us to ask if we were from town. We said yes and he asked if we knew of a safer place to walk because where he was coming from had “a lot of Natives around” (note that this is what I heard). We live in a country that likes to pretend it’s not racist but is and this is not the first time I have heard this. We live in an area where the Indigenous population is very integrated and people coming from other areas have commented on it. This is obviously a super bigoted comment and I got super prickly with him. My roommate was mostly silent during this conversation. I could see the guy was taken aback by how prickly I was, but he went his way and we went ours. It was then that my roommate said “I think he said ‘because there are a lot of needles on the ground’.” We live in a city and so this is an issue as it is in most other cities. I immediately felt like the biggest asshole and asked why he didn’t mention that before and he said he wasn’t sure that’s what the guy said (the guy was mumbling a bit). 

So I was a total asshole to this guy who was just looking for a safer place for his dog’s paws and I literally don’t know how to move on from this. I turned us around and tried to find him again so I could say sorry but didn’t find him. 

It has been ruminating in my thoughts ever since and I have an extremely difficult time letting go of situations like this. I was definitely in the wrong since I misheard what he said. I know logically I need to accept that I can’t change it and move on, but I don’t know how to do that. I now feel like I don’t ever want to go back into public because I apparently can’t even have a normal encounter with people.

Note 2: I don't think that anything in here is triggering?

When I was a little kid I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I remember being taken to lots of therapists and was eventually prescribed Lexapro, which I was essentially forced to take, and hated every second of it. I must have started taking it when I was maybe 8 years old, and made sure to convince my psych to take me off of it by the time I was legally allowed the rights to my own body (how insane is that?). I did everything that I could to convince him that I was fine, that I didn't have anxiety at all, etc. I finally stopped taking it at 14. 

Now, I need to mention that I'm female, now in my mid-20s. I haven't felt the need nor desire to take anxiety meds ever since I stopped as a teen. I think a massive factor that contributed to my anxiety was just dealing with my mom's unpredictable behaviors when I was little. She has PTSD from growing up with an alcoholic mother, absent father, and abusive stepfather. She also has anxiety and ADHD probably due to all of these things. I was an only child so as you can imagine, her emotional baggage was a lot for me to handle and something that I didn't fully understand until I became an adult. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD myself at 22, (I'm 25 now) when I was about to fail my thesis year of university. I've always had trouble finishing anything, visualizing time, and staying on task. The psych that I saw for this said that I was a classic case and that women are commonly underdiagnosed due to it presenting differently - we're a bit more prone to spacing out and being forgetful than our male counterparts who are more apt to bounce off of walls. She said that I was probably misdiagnosed with more severe anxiety than I actually had, and it could have been a mix of the two conditions, in turn aggravating all of the symptoms. I was prescribed Adderall IR and with it, I've been able to be productive ever since. I still have to work really hard at regulating my attention, but the medication helps.

I can say that I definitely haven't felt any significant anxiety ever since I moved out of my mom's house at 18.... until now. I don't know if what I'm feeling is an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but I think that it's all due to the stress of the pandemic. In terms of the actual illness, I don't want it, but that isn't what I'm worrying over. When the pandemic first hit, I was newlywed, overseas from my husband, waiting for my visa to go through. We were only supposed to be apart for two months, but it wound up being six. To top it all off, I was living at home with my parents, which brought up a lot of things that had been buried. That's when the anxiety started. 

It wasn't really constant worry. I was constantly depressed given the situation, but that was situational and I knew that I just had to be strong and handle it. Then one day, right before my husband came to my country to get me since it had been so long, I had my first ever panic attack. It was the weirdest thing. I didn't feel like I was having a heart attack or that I needed to go to the ER right away. I wasn't screaming or crying. It started with heart palpitations... but emotionally, I didn't feel panicked. I was working out one evening, I make sure that if I take Adderal, I do it in the morning so it wears off before I work out in the evening, so it was out of my system at that point. Of all things that I did to occupy myself and my mind during those hard months, exercise was my 'safe space'. It was an outlet. But one evening, on the treadmill, my heart felt really weird, like I was having palpitations, my left arm started hurting, and I felt like I was going to pass out. But I wasn't panicking. I stopped exercising and called the doctor the next morning who booked me an EKG for the next day.... it turned out normal. 

Once I knew that I was physically fine, I wasn't really worried about that, but my heart did still feel weird. I felt on edge. A few days later, just several days before my husband's flight, I absolutely could not sit still, focus, or calm down. I couldn't do my work, all I could do was pace. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I was worried about everything under the sun, ""what if the plane crashes?"", ""what if I fall down the stairs and die before I get to see my husband again,"" etc. etc. etc. to ridiculous and totally unrealistic levels.

I did everything that I could to regulate my emotions, deep breathing, yoga, exercise, meditation, lavender oil, but nothing stopped this feeling of absolute dread. I knew the fears were irrational but I couldn't get out of this downward spiral.

After three days of this, I called my GP and asked for anything, literally anything, to just help me get through the next 48 hours until my husband arrived because at that point I felt like I couldn't handle it on my own. I've never felt that way before. She prescribed me Ativan. Due to my childhood experience, I am very anti-meds. I didn't even like the idea of taking Adderall but appreciate the flexibility to decide if I want to take it or not on any given day. The Ativan did help, a lot, it kind of just ended the spiral and after two days of taking it, I felt a lot better and stopped. 

My husband did arrive safely, by the way, I did get my visa, and we packed up my things and went back overseas together. That's when the panic set back in. The day before we left and the day we traveled I was overwhelmed with dread, but not the same degree that I felt the first time. I tried to deal with it myself on day one, but did take the medication the day that we left in order to cope. 

I'm being hard on myself but I do have to acknowledge that these are extraordinary times, and my circumstances were very stressful. Being newly married and apart during an unprecedented global event, moving overseas during it all, etc. That's not your normal every day, and when I frame things that way, I handled it all arguably well.

I've been situated in the new country for four months now and haven't even felt the need to take the Ativan again... until the other day. Since getting here I've faced a decent amount of stressful things, moving out of the city when things got bad, searching for a job, knowing that I won't be able to see my family for Christmas, or for a while for that matter, adjusting etc. However, none of those stressful things or events actually set me off when it comes to this overwhelming dread. It just happens, preceded by a few nights of waking up in the middle of the night but otherwise feeling fine. Then there's the onset of the spiral where I just start worrying about everything under the sun, irrational, yet immobilizing thoughts. Again, I didn't experience this level of it since I moved, the level that I actually can't get under control on my own. 

Except for yesterday. The signs were clear, I was consistently waking up in the middle of the night for the past week, but otherwise feeling fine, I was actually in a good mood the day before it happened. However, that evening I just started feeling really overwhelmed. Yesterday morning I just felt utter dread. I exercised, listened to some meditation tapes, but still couldn't get it under control. I took an Ativan, and within 20 minutes the feeling of dread was irradicated. That evening and now, the following day, I feel normal. I think that I would still be in that spiral if I hadn't taken in, but I think this medication helps to just get me out of that spiral and to reset. 

I'm in the process of registering with a new GP over here and getting my ADHD medication sorted out, but due to this panic being a reoccurring thing, I want to talk to them about potentially getting something for it. However, I really, really don't want to be prescribed a daily medication. The thing about the Ativan is that the effects seem to last several days... or more, not that the medication is still acting but it lurches me out of this downward spiral. I don't know that much but I don't think that this is a chronic condition that needs daily treatment, other than the general stress of the times, I feel totally fine and normal 99.9% of the time. These panic episodes don't come about in any predictable cycle either. I've only had three. They're a very specific feeling too, not something that makes me go ""I wonder if that's what this is""... now that I know what it feels like, I know exactly when one is happening. I hesitate to call it a 'panic attack' either because I've read about them, seen my friends have them, and I'm not experiencing that ""heart attack"" or emergent feeling. It isn't really a moment. It's an episode that spans over a few days... and I don't actively panic, I don't scream and cry... it almost feels more like shock, I just get really quiet and can't really focus on anything outside of whatever ridiculous worries are going through my mind, but it's so overwhelming that I can't focus or dig myself out of it using healthy strategies that would normally take me out of a bad mood.

While I don't want to be on medications and definitely not *multiple* medications. I've realized that having it available might be, at least, a good safety net for if this happens again... which... I wouldn't say is outside of the realms of possibility. How can I speak to my new GP about this and specify that I really, really don't want to be on a daily pill and that I just want something short-acting that I can take only if I really, really need it?

Can anyone else relate to this? Is it situational and just due to the fact that we're living through really strange times? Is there something wrong with me? Is there a name for this 'panic episode' so that I could learn more about it? Is it PTSD?",Anxiety,"I think I started having 'panic episodes' this year, what's wrong with me?

1.0,"Hi, so kind of a long story but I'll make it as short as i can lol...

to start off I've had anxiety since I was 6 or 7 maybe and wasn't properly diagnosed till I was 14, I'm now 18 and have never been worse in my life. My mom and dad divorced 2 days before Christmas day when I was 12 and because my dad was the owner of the house he kicked me and my mom out and we had to go to my grandmas for Christmas with all our stuff in the car... at the time my dad was working in Saudi Arabia which was taking a toll on him I think because he wanted to be home and got angry easily while he was there. After 2 or 3years my mom met a guy and after which they started dating which I hated because I didn't trust him and he proposed to my mom after 11 months of them knowing each other (I know, WHAT THE F\*\*\*???) my mom stupidly said yes even though he had abused her before and continued to till they spilt up last year which the divorce hasn't been able to take place because of the current situation.

the guy used to be in the army and had clearly seen some shit because he'd randomly start screaming in the night which scared the hell out of me enough. he was also clearly an alcoholic, he'd hide whiskey bottles in a freezer we had in the garage and he would be VERY drunk every night of the week which is not a good combination because he used to abuse my mom physically and mentally too. there's been multiple occasions when he's kicked down doors in the house that my mom locked to get away from him while I would hide under my bed on the phone to the cops (I know I should of done something to stop him but the amount of fear that rushed through my body was insane and I felt like I couldn't move a muscle, I also wasn't about to go fight an ex soldier when I was a scrawny 15 year old without getting some bones broken so I stayed under my bed and spoke to cops instead) after these multiple incidents every time the cops came my mom would say he didn't abuse her so he didn't get arrested and even one time because he was drunk the cops told me and my mom to leave OUR OWN HOUSE and stay in a hotel!!!!

That is just one of the many many many stories by the way... So fast forward to now, I have been talking to my therapist about the things that went on and how I felt and she thinks that I have suffered traumas from all the events of him because I know struggle to go to sleep, I feel like has always watching me or following me around, even as I'm typing this I see a red car across the street where a guy has been sitting in there for at least an hour doing nothing which is really freaking me out. i also have a lot of nightmares about stuff has done and constantly wake up in the night. I also kind of blame my mom in a way for constantly forgiving stuff that he's done to me and her, she only now really understands what I have to deal with on a daily basis and is constantly seeing if am ok and if I need anything (being really supportive basically)

essentially if anyone has read this far what I'm asking is: does it get better? will this go away? I cant deal with the constant fear and tiredness because I only get a few hours sleep and thoughts that he's trying to break in to hurt me and my mom...",Anxiety,Throwaway account because im embarrased,Early life,LD EL1.csv
1.0,"Hi all, although I frequent Reddit I’ve never had an account so I made one because I felt like this post is important. 

Sparing the details, I can link the my depression to a specific month about two and a half years ago, just after my first year of university. At its peak, I remember spending at least 80% of my day stressed about how I felt, evaluating my emotions quite problematically, and at some point compulsively reading posts just like this to validate that “some day I was going to be okay”. (If you do that consider stopping it was definitely a crutch for me). It was really this notion of being okay that haunted me because it felt impossible, and doing what I was doing ensured that it was. I remember days where I thought I would be happier dead. I lived with this for over 2 years.

About two months ago I confided in a close friend and had a good cry, they weren’t really able to do much but offer support. I promised myself I would never tell anyone about it (I guess that made it real) and one day I just snapped mid conversation and let it all out. I understand that this is not a solution for everyone, and quite frankly it wasn’t that which sparked my feeling better, it was finally accepting that what I am feeling is okay, it’s allowed, and I’m not crazy, just a little anxious.

Looking back, it took about a month still to fully accept myself for who I am, sad feelings and all, and then that next month to finally be able to look back at those feelings from a distanced and rational place. The minute I stopped shaming myself for feeling this way, and for not immediately feeling better each time I tried something I was able to overcome those overwhelming thoughts. 

“A watched lawn doesn’t grow” 

I understand that what worked from me and what made me feel better will not work for most people, but I beg of you to at the very least head my advice. Please understand that you are not alone, there is nothing wrong with you, and I promise, one day you WILL wake up not “feeling better”, but not even thinking about it. That can’t happen if you observe every ounce of happiness and try to squeeze meaning out meaningless things. Please know that you are loved and this isn’t the end of the world, I promise.",depression,"It’s going to get worse before it gets better, and it does get better",Early life,LD EL1.csv

1.0,"Hi all, 

I am confused and worried about my younger sister, who seems to not really be developing in life at all. She has no career ambitions, no ambitions to do anything, and no hobbies whatsoever (except one that I’ll discuss).

As a 21 year old, I feel that she should be in the phase of her life where she’s exploring herself and the world, going out with friends, etc. the problem is that she has no fiends. She hasn’t had any friends since high school. I remember her as a child being so happy and outgoing. Now she’s very to herself, and she has some very bad habits.

For one thing, she’s very overweight. She just seems to love food and really eats a lot. It’s obviously a problem, but she’s not doing anything about it. I don’t even know if she wants to do anything about it. 

Another thing is that she collects dolls and toys, which might be seen as a hobby and not really a problem, but she goes overboard. She has so many and buys more all the time. It seems almost like an addiction, besides the fact that it’s a little strange for someone her age to have so many dolls.

She is in college right now, but barely getting by. She chose a major that I don’t even think she’s interested in, she just chose it to get a degree. I tried to have a talk with her the other day about possible career choices, ambitions, things she finds fun or interesting. I got nothing. Absolutely nothing.
 I asked her if she would like to travel anywhere, she said it’s a waste of time and money. I asked her what she really might want to do for a career, she said she wouldn’t mind working at the Costco food court, which is perfectly fine, but I don’t think she really meant it. I really don’t think she’s interested in working at all.

Currently she is young and lives at home with parents. But I am worried about what her future will look like, and her mental state. She has been to a psychiatrist who prescribed her antidepressants, but after a month or two she didn’t want to take them anymore because of how they made her feel. She has not yet been to a therapist. 

One more thing, she had some sort of an episode a few months ago where she got extremely upset at my mother because she believed that my mother was covering up things that happened to her when she was very young. Things that really don’t seem to be true or make sense at all. Kind of like false memories. She’s not hearing voices or anything like that. We were worried she had schizophrenia or some other mental disorder, but the psychiatrist ruled that out.

Would they brush me off? Say they've had worse? That life is like that? I do not want these answers from them, as they said that to my brother lots of times. They think of me as sheltered and spoiled to the point where things I experience are the first time like recently getting blisters on my feet and being worried about it. They laugh at the idea that a woman should treat herself as a pregnant woman the moment she's sexually active. You know, stuff like that. 

So much childhood sexual abuse. I can't believe that I've experienced this shit since I turned 18. But I hate the idea of therapy and medication. I thought that I can fix myself, maybe I can, but I do not have the methods, tools, and answers to heal this pain. I'm so stressed. I'm so stressed my body hurts. My neck and upper back feels so tense and strained, no matter what I do it's back to its tense form. My face feels blank. I feel helpless, but I am offered help so many times. 

Why do I brush off other commenters? Everytime someone say ""I'm sorry you've experienced this"" I just brush it off until I'm broken down again? Am I really okay? Why am I having a crisis and making this post when I might be normal again in a few hours?

In my early teens I developed depression. The only thing I wanted to do  and had motivation for, was gaming.  Now I'm almost 18 and it's only gotten worse.

1.0,"My mom always tells this funny story about how I was a very adventurous baby, so as soon as I was big enough to climb out of my crib, I threw myself out of it and onto the floor. Hard. The next day they went out and got me a big girl bed so I couldn’t do that again (I have not purposefully flung myself off of my bed and to the ground since then, so big girl beds have been a success lol). 

Anyways that story about me throwing myself on the floor as a baby is relevant because I’ve recently learned that brain trauma and head injuries in childhood can lead to depression later in life. Guess who’s had depression for literally as long as I can remember, with no helpful treatments? (Me). For a long time I didn’t even realize I had depression, because I didn’t know that there was any different way to feel, it wasn’t until I got worse that I started to suspect anything. It’s weird to look back at my life and habits as a 3 year old, an 8 year old, a 12 year old, and know that the reason why I was the way I was, is because I’ve actually had depression all my life. I started looking for treatments in my teen years, and since then I’ve tired CBD oil, smoking and drinking, quitting smoking and drinking, therapy, meds, quitting meds, meditation, writing a journal, drinking lots of water, getting lots of sleep, and all kinds of other suggestions, but nothing has ever actually made me feel any better. 

I used to just think I was failing at treatments because I wasn’t trying hard enough, but if my depression is a result of a childhood head injury and not from another kind of cause, then the treatment plan would likely look very different. Instead of learning to live with it through therapy and mindfulness, or re balance the misfiring neurotransmitters through meds, then the real cure could have to do with finding ways to treat old brain injuries. During mental health profiling, nobody ever asks you if you’ve ever hit your head really hard, or if you’ve had any kind of head trauma, but that question might be helpful for people who haven’t been responding to traditional treatments. 

I never realized or considered that possibility when trying to look for the source of (and hopefully a cure for) my depression. It has just always been with me, and I fear it always will be.

I don't know why I choose to reject happiness. It was offered to me so blatantly. Everything I ever wanted fell into place. Whether it be a higher power or just happenstance I had it.

Nothing brings me joy or happiness, I’ve been on antidepressants for 5 years now and I just feel like this is how life will be until someday when I don’t wake. When I was younger , I had friends, nice girls would want to date me, I had a social life and things to look forward to. Now there’s none of that, I’ve had awful date after awful date over the last couple of years, with the kind of girls that I would never consider “wife material”. At 39 I don’t want to date a 21 year old with daddy issues, or someone with 5 kids but that’s basically all that comes my way these days

I had a traumatic childhood which I’ve never really gotten over. No one knows the abuse I suffered, my parents think I was a quiet child but don’t know why. They assume I was just someone who loved books a little too much,  but they don’t know that books and video games were my escape.

When I look back at my life, I feel like I have tried my best and utterly failed. I’ve always been kind, even now I’m the kind of guy who talks to homeless people , I’ll buy them food and listen to them. I’m kind to my niece and nephew and their smiles are maybe one of the few times when I feel warm and alive. I can’t recall the last time I was a dick to anyone, heck even my best friend jokingly calls me “Jesus” for how selfless i am at times

Despite doing all the right things, I’m alone most of the time, I’m forced to work from home due to current circumstances, when I look ahead , the odds of ever marrying or becoming a father are pretty much nil.

I’ve never really spoken about this to anyone so I’ve decided to just let it all out here since no one will know who I really am. It’s crazy to think that I’ve been struggling with depression since I was a kid. My cousins took advantage of me and my innocence. They molested me and threaten if I ever spoke up no one would believe me. One did things to me when I was only 5 another cousin when I was 8 and the last when I was 10. When I was 11 my grandma passed away from cancer and I could never cope with it and still can’t to this day. Then comes a different part of my life. I was going to start middle school/jr high with no friends bc I was bullied by my “friends” in elementary. At 14 I made friends with the wrong crowd and was taking ecstasy as a cry out for help. One time I had taken 5 pills and mix it with tequila ready to just end my life even tho I didn’t know that’s what I was doing. At the same time I began take those pills I was discovering my sexuality. I was at my rock bottom but I was able to pick myself up.

I tried so hard to make friends hs but for some reason everyone hated me. Maybe they knew about my drug addiction? Who knows. I was jumped my junior year and suspended from school for it. I met my first gf ever and I was happy for the first time in a long time or so I thought. She cheated on me and verbally and physically abused me. I tried to dead my life again but didn’t succeed. I graduated hs and my family was so proud of me but I saw myself as a failure. I tried to go to college and took a few classes but the fear of not being able to make friends and feeling alone scared me too much so I dropped out and disappointment my parents. 

I started working and thought everything was going well for me but then I started drinking every single night in my room by myself. I then started working in a theme park and made a few friends working there and even found someone I fell for. She was out and wanted to keep it a secret and which is exactly what my first gf did and I agreed to it but then it started again. I was being manipulated and abused by her. She made me believe she was the only one there for me and my friends weren’t my friends but when my grandfather passed away she was nowhere to be found and my friends were there for me. The relationship was very toxic and we decided we were better off as friends with benefits but even then she was horrible to me. One night she told me I made the relationship up in my head and what we had never happened. That’s when I knew it was time to ended everything. She made me feel like I was going crazy and I was drinking a lot more and tried to kill myself again but I couldn’t do it bc I thought about me causing my family so much pain.

Months later I download tinder and met someone and we just clicked. I fell so hard for her and then I drove out to see her almost 2hrs away from my place. I was so happy but I knew in order for it to work one of us had to move so I decided I would do it and so I did. I left everything behind and I was depressed again. All the friends I had made stopped talking to me I had no one at here and I was having a hard time getting a job. She was able to get me a job where she work but I wasn’t happy. I got a job somewhere else and I was so happy. I thought I would be able to make friends in this city but I was wrong. I was treated (still am) like an outsider. No one made me feel welcomed instead they all judged me for being a lesbian and made little comments and gossiped behind my back even went as far as started a group chat to talk about me. 

And now we’re here. Im all alone and can’t talk to anyone about my problems because I feel like no one will understand me. I live in a city where I barely know how to get around and don’t have any friends I can run to for advice or just to hang out with. I wish I had someone I could talk to. I can’t even tell my gf or family anything because i don’t want to disappoint them or burden them. Sometimes I feel like i’ll be okay and then bam I think about everything I’ve been through in my life and how many times I tried to end my life and sometimes I wish I would have just done it so I wouldn’t here.

1.0,"I just feel like I’m so used to feeling so miserable and having days all the time that I forgot what happiness truly feels like; especially considering the fact my depression developed when I was 10 years old and  now. My therapist said to me today “Well, you may be confused as to what happiness truly is” meaning that the happiness of being innocent and not having to worry about you know, important things, may differ from what happiness is supposed to feel like now, considering the fact that I’m older and have been caring about things such as politics and social justice issues. She asked me “what do you think changed, after your parents got divorced” I thought about that and I’ve come to a somewhat conclusion: I realized how fragile life in general is. How relationships fall apart. How people die every single day. How if I choose to do something different EVER, I effect my future. I know that’s just how life works but it absolutely fucking sucks. Also, the realization that the world is a horrible place, filled with nothing but people who thrive for power and wealthiness. The realization even with the petitions we sign to aid that all of the horrible things that are actively happening, we can’t fix them. At the end of the day, I’m just a kid with internet. It just how the world works. Considering the fact I couldn’t even begin to tell all of my friends about this, it feels good to have someone to talk to. That’s another thing, although I have friends who love me, I feel so alone. All the time. No matter what I do. I would do ANYTHING to bring back that pure joy and innocence I felt a few years ago. I wish I wouldn’t have to look back at my teen years in the future and regret not “living them”. Life is terrifying. It’s as simple as that. And even though I will admit, I have some unrealistic expectations set for my teenage years, I know that crying myself to sleep every night and feeling misery every single day is not even CLOSE to what’s I consider a good use of them.

1.0,"Since it's my cake day, I thought I'd tell the story of how I began battling my most difficult depression spell. I'm on mobile right now, so please disregard any issues with this post.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was a kid, and I can honestly say it's one of the hardest things to deal with growing up and even now that I'm an adult. I used to go to therapy, but I didn't really see the benefit of it. For years, I would just wing it. Sonedays this worked, but a lot of days it didn't, but I persevered. In 2016, I began living with my alcoholic father in his one bedroom apartment. He'd drink a couple of fifths a night, piss his bed sometime while he was asleep, then wake up for work, take a few gulps from the bottle, and head out for work. At this time I wasn't working, so I'd be left inside the tiny apartment on the couch I'd sleep on, with only instant ramen noodles, and if I were lucky, some sandwich meat to eat. I was not in a good place, but again, I persevered. It was at this point that I met a woman that seemed to be like an angel to me, an escape from the shitty little apartment I was wasting away in. We began dating, I moved in with a friend, and I got a job. Things seemed to be looking up. About half a year into my relationship with this woman, I began to notice signs of her cheating on me. Once, I even caught her exchanging nudes with a girl at her college which was about to hours away from where I lived. Any time I had caught her doing something scandalous, she would cry and tell me how much she didn't want me to leave and how she would change. I forgave her any time she would cry because I felt bad for making her upset. After this, we began fighting more often, but no matter what we were fighting about, she would ultimately convince me that I was the cause of the fight, and I would accept it. This continued for 8 more months. Within these 8 months, I moved into my first apartment with three of my friends. The day we moved in was my birthday, and I was working hard to get all of out furniture into our new living arrangement. My girlfriend was incredibly upset because we were spending my birthday moving into my apartment instead of on a day long date like we would normally do while she was in town. At one point, I left her alone with my roommate so that I could go get a couch from the next city over. While I was gone, she slept with my roommate. When I got back, she seemed to be in a much better mood, but it didn't stop her from fighting with me more about how we didn't go on a date all day. So I finally caved, I took her out to get some ice cream, and we enjoyed that moment together. We came back home, she then presented me with my birthday present; some new sheets and a comforter for my bed. Then while we were settling down to sleep, we got into another fight. She ripped the sheets and the comforter from my bed, and proceed to take them to my closet where she made an area for herself in the floor to sleep. As always, I would apologize for the fight, and I eventually convince her to put the sheets back onto the bed so we could get some sleep. The fights began getting worse. One night I picked her up from work, and when I dropped her off at home, I told her we couldn't be together anymore. She then refused to get out of my car, so I got out so I could tell her family that we were over and that she was refusing to get out of my car. She didn't like this, so she got out of the car and began hitting me before I could get to her parent's front door. So here we are, in the driveway of her parent's home and she's continuously hitting me until I eventually calm her down, forgive her, and tell her we can give it another chance. At this point, my mental health was becoming too difficult of an issue for me to continue to ignore. So I took the path of self destruction to finally put an end to the relationship, and I did so by cheating on her with another woman. The next time we hung out, I confessed what I had done to her, and of course, she broke down in front of me, but then she forgave me and convinced me we could try again. I accepted, but the next time we fought, I just stopped talking to her for about a month. I remember the last time I talked to her, she wanted me to drive two hours to stay the night with her and I almost did, but I had finally convinced myself to stay away for good. She had convinced me that all the problems in our relationship were solely mine and mine alone, and I truly believed her. The woman that I cheated on her with wanted to be with me, as she had wanted since highschool and I felt obligated to give her a relationship. A few days into the relationship I realized that I didn't want to be with her, so I broke up with her one text and began to isolate myself. Eventually we kicked out the roommate that had slept with my ex, and I further began to isolate myself by cutting off connection with several people, and once I was finally alone, the gravity of everything came crashing down. The weight of my depression made it difficult to get out of bed most days, and I spent my time in my room thinking about killing myself, and how to prevent my other roommates from interfering. I was convinced that I was the sole reason for all of my misery, for my failed friendships and my relationship with this woman that did nothing but hurt me. In December of 2017, I deleted my social media, created a new Reddit account, changed my phone number, and I even started a new job. Getting away from social media helped clear my head a bit, but my self isolation continued and began to worsen. Two years later, my isolation was nearing it's conclusion, and I was preparing to kill myself. One day at work, I saw a woman outside I decided that I was going to strike up a conversation with her. I don't know where I got the courage to talk to her, but it felt like I was obligated to do it. While brief, we formed a slight connection, but it wouldn't be until a month or two later that it would finally take shape. She asked me out 6 times, and I either denied her because I didn't feel like I was good enough/ready for a relationship or I accepted her invitation for a date and then I would promptly cancel the same day due to the same anxiety of not being good enough/ready. I remember a night where she came over to hang out, and I was feeling really low, and after she left, I broke down in front of my friends and I told them that it wouldn't matter if I killed myself because they wouldn't consider checking on me until days later and that even if they did come to check up on me, I would have blocked the door with my dresser. This was my lowest point of this 3 year long, seemingly neverending nightmare that was my mental health. Eventually they calm me down enough to where they feel like they can leave me alone, and then one of them ended up convincing me to just dating this woman, and so I did. When we started dating, we were basically attached at the hip. I would always spend the night at her place, we would spend all day together, carpool to work, ect. You really couldn't separate us. During this time, she helped me work through my mental health issues and after several trying months, I finally broke free of the rut I had been trapped in. Ever since then, I still battle with my mental health, but now I wasn't alone. I finally had someone at my side who genuinely cared about my well-being. Now it's almost two years later, and I'm doing better than I have ever been since I was diagnosed. 

Tl;dr and what I learned:
After a very long depressive spell, I finally found the support I needed. 

What I learned from this is that not everyone is going to be there for you. Sometimes your parents won't help you, sometimes the people you think you have a genuine bond with aren't really the people you thought they were. I learned that social media is highly destructive to mental health, that even though someone is telling you constantly that you're wrong and you're telling yourself you're wrong that you were never really in the wrong to begin with. I learned that isolating yourself and ignoring the issue does a lot more damage then it helps. 

Most importantly, I learned that even when it seems like everyone has turned your back on you and that life seems hopeless, that you'll find the support you need and that there is a way out of the rut. 

I hope you all have a great day and that whoever is struggling finds their way out of the rut.",depression,"Three years ago, I began to fight a most difficult battle with depression.",Early life,LD EL1.csv

I immediately moved in with my father (who until 2 years prior was unaware of my existence). In the same year my sister was born 5 years my younger. My father was a victim of his own abuse, a father who would beat him, and torture him. He eventually ran away and started a new life. My father was around in my life but emotionally unavailable. Between K-12 I went to 9 different schools, and had 4 different step mothers. I had a sister, as mentioned, but she spent only the weekends with us. My childhood was mostly spent alone in my room trying to occupy myself. My dad was always too busy to talk to me. 

I guess my reason for verbalizing all this is realizing that I was depressed then and still am now. I don’t know if I’ve ever known was it was like not to be depressed. I feel like I ruin relationships with other people and with work because I always sink into depression again and become self-destructive.

1.0,"How to deal with anger towards dad ( long post sorry)

So I’m a19yr old, who hates their dad. My dad was never really around growing up. He travel a lot for his job so he would usually be in town for a day or two at most. The only time where he would pay attention to me was when he grounded me or told me how dumb and useless I was. Anytime I would show emotion he would get angry. If I even shed one tear he would scream at me. I could never be around my mom when he was around. He would get furious if I tried getting her attention away from him. In my early teens years my dad started to get my mom to tag along with him while he travel leaving my brothers and I behind at home. Eventually my dad had to moved a few hrs away for work and my mom, older brother ,and I stay behind. At the same time my dad had promise my aunt that him and my mom would care for my two younger cousins for a year while they went to school here. But thing is that my dad realized he need my mom to go live with him bc he needed someone to cook and clean for him. So originally, plan was for my mom to look after my cousins and make sure they did well in school but it led to me doing that as a freshmen in high school. my older brother wasn’t around much bc he was a full time college student and employee.  So he wouldn’t check up on me or let alone my parents to make sure I was doing well in class or even if I was going to school at all. I had to do all the cleaning and cooking at home on top of taking care of those two kids. I almost never had time to sleep nor eat. I had to constant clean and cook food for everyone. Every time my parents visited us my dad would point out anything and everything I did or did not do correctly. I almost fail freshmen year bc I couldn’t keep up with school work. My dad made me drop out of softball and marching band bc he said those were unnecessary distractions and that I needed to be at home. I finally had enough with everything and had a breakdown and begging for my mom to come home and stay with me but my dad just told me how ungrateful and selfish I was. I was ruining everything for them. No one will ever want me with me if I had that attitude. My mom didn’t say a word to me for days. Since then I never complained about the situation. I bottle up all my emotions never letting anyone in. I started to develop severe anxiety and depression. After a while we all started to live together again but I soon realize my parents were only looking after my brothers. My parents never checked on me if I was doing well in school nor personally. Only time they talk to me was when i did something wrong or to tell me my brother was better than me. Fast forward to me being in college now being extremely independent from my parents, they are now trying to get involved in my personal life. My mom is a lot more welcoming and warm than she was in my younger years. Yet I constantly have to remind my dad about basic things he should already know bc his my parent. He doesn’t remember what college I go to let alone my major. He doesn’t remember that I’m vegetarian nor that I have food allergies. Literally he doesn’t remember the bare minimum. Yet he manages to remember every detail of my brothers childhood and such. It is a known fact between my parents that I have severe anxiety but my dad says I’m just acting out bc I’m a spoil brat. But at the same he drops everything for my brother whenever he shows any signs of distress. It is painfully obvious that my brother is my dad favorite while my other oldest brother is my moms. Which leads to me being left out all the time. I have so much anger built up from being emotionally abandoned from a young age to being constantly gaslighted, etc. I just don’t know how to deal with this anger that appears every time I’m near my dad.

1.0,"Hi reddit friends,

There is something only few people know about. When I was a little child, maybe around 3 or 4 years old, my mother was hospitalized on a mental health clinic far away from the place where we lived. I stayed with my grandparents (her parents) but no one told me about what was happening. She was just gone. I think that as long as time passed I felt I would never see her again. Probably it lasted 2 or 3 months but for me it was like a year. The only thing I can remember is that my grandfather built me a swing and the day my mother arrived. I can't remember his face, I can't remember if she was similing at me or not. I can't remember if I felt joy or not. I only can slightly remember that she brought me a pink box with something inside (don't know what). I can only remember that pink little box and that she was on the main door arriving with bags and things. I can't remember nothing before or after that. I can't remember if she hugged me or kissed me or what she told me or if we moved inside, nothing... I think I only can see that I was in such a great pain.
It happens to me that I almost can't remember anything about my early childhood, like at age 8 or 9. I have very few memories and the ones I have are about pain. I suffered a lot during my childhood. My mother was depressed, I felt abandoned and not loved, sometimes she beated me for nothing, I suffered bullying at school, my mother had a violent boyfriend that beated me and her. Sometimes I came from school and I was alone at home. One time I was frozen by fear and pain because my mother didn't arrived at home until it was like 1 or 2 am. I felt like I would lose her forever.
As I grew up I also became depressed, probably I always felt a great pain inside me but my depression kicked me at age 16. Now I am 31, female and still struggling very hard with depression. I have been on lots of different types of therapy and meds and there is something inside me that is like just blocked /frozen and I can't even cry. I have no one to cry with too. My mother died at 2014 from suicide. My father died when I was 9 but never lived with him. I don't have any uncles/aunts or siblings. My grandparents are dead too. I had a great boyfriend but I`ve losed him because of my mental health problem. I feel that something is really stuck inside and feels like I still in a big deep pain that I try to overcome.

Finally settle in and make friends, then my parents split and my girlfriend cheats on me. However this is all just a prelude for the worst mistake of my life. I have Aspergers so it’s easy to get me angry. My friends intentionally get me mad to the point I make death threats to them. I calm myself down eventually and move on.

Now my dream is crushed and I’ll never get the chance to play with them again. I’ll never be able to live it down and people will look at me differently.

1.0,"I've always been tired, you know? I don't remember feeling happy; just always portrayed the facade everyone easily falls for, including myself. My life wasn't exactly the happiest, from being sexually harassed for years as a little child to witnessing my parents engage in domestic violence everything single day for the first twelve years of my life alone. Despite that, I did my best not to let it get to me. 


Then the bullying started. I was the passionate kid who loved to speak up about what was wrong and was proud of their identity as someone who hailed from a third world country that was persistently bombed. That reason, that lack of embarrassment about coming from such a nation it led to them calling me so many things. They dropped me from countless events and competitions knowing I was the best student from the class. They would lie about me to my parents, telling them I'm the bad influence in the class and how I'm getting other people on the wrong path. My mother would blame it all on me instead of ever defending me. I had to fight for myself, to defend my character and who I was. Almost as if that wasn't enough, my friends would call me derogatory terms while claiming to be my good friends; in their eyes, I was the refugee (despite being born here), I was fat, I was ugly, I was 'too manly' for a girl, I was the one to be blamed for in case something went wrong in friendships among themselves. I was the one who had to be at fault for everything. I was only twelve years old or younger when this happened. 


When I became thirteen, I developed passion for politics and humanity affiliated field. Looking into it, I realised there were people in places worse than mine; that's when I felt the insane urge to help and fight for them. This felt like life being blown into me. I had finally discovered a purpose to live. Like I wanted to dedicate my life helping people and fighting for their rights.I loved justice, I wanted to help the people who hailed from countries by providing them justice in humanitarian courts. I was so excited. I was so excited to finish high school and chase my dream. I started to study human rights law from the age of fifteen, educated myself on what to and what to not do. My life somehow got on track, I didn't care about the rest of the world despising my new nonchalant attitude, I didn't care about the bullying, I didn't care about anything but my future career. It was such a thrilling feeling, you know? To discover a purpose in life. I felt like I had a reason to continue living, not for myself because I never believed I existed for myself; God had made me for anyone but my own self. Finding this was so beautiful, so relieving, so happy. 


You see, my father is a man who values status above everything. When I turned 17 and the decision of me entering college came, he shouted his brains out when I told him I wanted to go for law. He said a bunch of misogynistic things about the field not being for women and whatnot. He told me I would never have a future in it. And that is when I got forced into medicine, a field I hated more than my very life. 

I got my passion stripped from me. The very thing that made me look forward to life. That singular thing which made me feel a shred of happiness, that thing I worked so hard for. I lost my purpose. 

But you know? I was still okay with it. I just wept about it for a month and told myself to get over it. It is what it is, right? By then, I had developed a strong insatiable obsession with existential nihilism, and that ideology helped me get over losing my dream, albeit in a very unhealthy way. At that time, I also got told I suffered from dysthymia and ADHD. So yahoo!! Fun, isn't it? 

You see, I despise the country I live in. I have no positive memory of being here, none. I hate it. I wanted to leave it, so I thought maybe if I work hard enough 2 years into pre-med and get enough decent grades, I'll be allowed to get into a university somewhere else. So yeah, I worked for it. 

Until today when I got told I'm supposed to finish my medicine in this country. That's another 8 years spent here, with these people, this society, this environment that despises me. 

I honestly can't do it. I genuinely can't. I have reached my point. My breaking point. I've always wanted to die, but I had always been too scared to go for it. I've always wanted to live, but I can't do that either. I feel like I'm living for the two people who have destroyed me and my sense of self-identity all to a point I don't know who I am. I can't run from here, it's impossible. I would've tried but I can't. My youth will go by but I'll be trapped, having to fake happiness just so that my mother and father do not mentally manipulate me and tell me things I CAN'T stand hearing. I can't do this. 

I could've been a bright kid.. Maybe an amazing person with so much to live for, but I am tired. I can't live anymore. It's too much. I'm tired. I'm so tired. I can't do this for another eight years. I've been fighting for so long, even when my own body wanted to give up. I have genuinely never once felt happy until I had found something I loved, but it got taken in the name of materialistic shit. I'm fucking tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of everything, I'm tired of being told I'm not studying hard, I'm tired of being told I am talentless, I'm tired of being compared to those kids who got into this field by will, I'm tired of being asked why I can't do well like them when I never wanted to do this to begin with.

Throwaway due to obvious reasons, I won't disclose any personal details besides the fact I'm 21 M. I'm getting CBT next year and for the mean time, I've been doing breathing techniques, listening to biaural soundtracks. Reading more. I also want to get into mediating more.

I had a chaotic childhood growing up: a deadbeat father who cheated on my mother and never paid child support, a half-brother and a depressed, heavily religious mom who physically and mentally abused me and brothers whom I suspect sexually molested me (i believe this is child-on-child sexual abuse but most of my childhood is blurry.) I also suspect a girl possibly took advantage of me during elementary school (this is also blurry.) We grew up in poverty and my mum became an excessive hoarder to the point I could never bring anyone over and my mum would often blame the mess on us. I grew up in fear of my mum and half-brother where violence, punishment, verbal abuse was rife in the house as a kid. I remember self-harming as early as I was eleven. Although now, we seem to be more normal and healthier, nobody ever brings up the past.

I endured a lot of bullying solely for the color of my skin during school and this messed up my self-esteem massively - where I became this toxic masculinity guy growing up along with friends who peer pressured me. I remember looking at myself in the mirror and wishing I was white sometimes.

I grew up depressed and confused about life, especially being a ""black poor man."" I wasn't eating, sleeping, washing myself or cleaning my room. I spend money recklessly. I'll self-harm quite a bit when I wanted to hurt myself in some capacity. I ruminate a lot about my future, I drown it all out by smoking too much weed or drinking too much. I rarely talk about my feelings unless it was in an unhealthy manner. I didn't know who I was so I spent a lot of time on the internet, specifically Twitter where people found me cool, funny and attractive. I saw the internet as real life because real life fucking sucked.

 I branded a personality and I de-attached myself from reality where I was this depressed loser piece of shit who worked at a fast food restaurant, didn't have any happy youthful memories or whatever. I used to be a misogynistic creepy pos to women, I lied about being a vegetarian when I used to secretly eat meat, I people-please, I lie about small things, I pretend that everything is fine. I ghost on people. I run away and hide and ruminate about how I'm a shitty person who is a fraud of a human. I wasn't emotionally stable enough for my ex-girlfriend, she showed me her world and I didn't because it meant looking at myself, my past self. I was cruel to her at times (never abused or did anything super-fucked up) but I said some mean things sometimes. Of course, I apologised but still She loved me so much and I didn't really know how to love her because I didn't know how to love myself and recieve love. I tried so hard though. She said I'm wasn't a shitty boyfriend and I believe I tried my best even though I hurt her feelings at times. She gave me the best memories of my life and I hate to think that she wasted her moments on someone like me.

After a failed suicide attempt two months ago and multiple breakdowns I've decided I need help. I spent too long pretending things are fine and that I'm fine when I'm not. I went counselling in June and it helped a bit. I need to sort myself out, I think I suffer from depression, anxiety, autism and probably some other shit too, I don't know but I hate my brain and I want to say it here: I put myself down so much because all of my life I have been put down. And I'm tired of it. I deserve to love myself, I deserve to recieve love from others and I want you guys to know, you do too. It's hard but when there's love around and you let absorb it without that voice in the back of your head telling you: You're not worthy of this because you're broken and you will always be.

I've made a lot of bad moves in my life and I judged myself for it, further putting me into that hole of depression - what if I went to this college and made new friends instead of spending so much time on Twitter talking to randos because they liked me or what if I didn't realise they were people who actually liked being with me in real life. What if I wasn't a creepy piece of shit and even thought I was a predator at one point. What if I got help earlier? However, I can acknowledge I've been a dickhead to people, even if I didn't have the intention to do so, I can't change the past - all I can do is make amends and be better to others in the future.

I'll always have depression in some form but I don't want it to have a chokehold on my life. I want to travel the world, I want to have a loving girlfriend and be a good father to my children. I want to go to festivals and do all sorts of cool shit. I want to graduate University and maybe even get a masters. I want to get a cat. I want to drive a car.

1.0,"
I'm currently 16 years old, turning 17 in January. I've been suffering with pretty severe social anxiety disorder since I started high school (age 13 in UK) which prevented me from expanding my friend group. in high school I was friends with people I have known since a very young age, and only 3ish people I met through high school, which were all terrible role models and made my mental health a lot worse, they were typical bullies thirsty for validation from peers and would all be horrible to each other behind each others back, the bullying wasn't limited to other people, it would happen in the friend group too.

 this all stopped when i finally got ""home-schooled"" when school discovered I had SAD, I've been getting ""home-schooled"" for about a year now. the home-schooling consisted of me being mailed work, which the school didn't even check if i completed or not. i haven't heard from my high school friend group since I left high school a year ago, none of them checked up one me once, 2 of them blocking me on social media. I always wished i could just be left alone and not have to associate with any of them, but being the anxious person i am i was always worried about being the ""outcast"" I guess you could say. I didn't want to be the one kid walking around alone at break.

Since then I've been so much happier alone, I've only got 2 ""friends"" right now, which both request favours from me but never return them, so essentially using me. I'm fine with this, as i barely make contact with them at this point. There was a period where i weren't friends with them for 8-9 months this year and i was perfectly fine, i had no problem with it. I see a lot of people especially on social media that crave a relationship in some way or another, always needing to be with friends, partying with others, you name it.

 I don't know if my situation is a good thing or not, I've never been a sociable person and spend my days inside on my computer, working (paid hobby, not really job), or just laying in bed, watching youtube or another source of entertainment. I don't know how to feel about this.

1.0,"It is my first holiday season alone because I am taking time away from toxic family and I want to share my story. It's a bit long so bear with me or read the TLDR at the bottom. 

M 25

Working through childhood trauma and I thought it would be a good place to share my story and get some feedback. This is an abbreviated version and I may not have all the details, but I will give it a shot.

My life basically began with a nasty divorce between my parents. My mom got custody of myself and my two brothers and I never saw my dad after he left when I was 4. I always remembered my dad for how my mom described him, and she was always telling us to hate him and shunned us from speaking about him. 

Growing up I was always loyal to my mom. But she put myself and my brothers through a lot of emotional abuse. Lots of screaming and punishment for no apparent reason, so my home life was centered around not pissing off my mom.

From that divorce, I started having suicidal thoughts as a second grader. Social rejection from my peers on top of my parents separating made me feel unwanted, and I didn't want to be here anymore. When my teachers brought it up to my mom, she flipped the fuck out on me. Most of her rants were threats of child services coming and taking me away, and that our family would be destroyed if I didn't keep my mouth shut. She always said ""you'll be running your fucking mouth out of that court room."" She never brought me to a psychologist or psychiatrist. And I am pretty sure it was to avoid getting child services involved.

She always would threaten my brothers and I with abandonment. She always said she was leaving to another state and that we had to fend for ourselves. She would send us to our rooms and pretend like she was packing her things, get in her vehicle and drive off. When she left, my oldest brother would kick the shit out of me because it was my fault my mom left. 

So this lead to a lot of psychological problems and I have been suicidal for most of my life. I am not sure I know what real joy or love actually feels like, since it was always quickly followed by pain and guilt. 

Later in life I found out that my mom only married my dad so she could get money from his tribe (he is Native American, as am I). I wrote my dad during the pandemic last spring and found out that her intention on having myself and my brothers was so she could claim trust money that our tribe gives to enrolled children. She coerced myself and my brothers out of our tribal money saying she was ""investing in ***our*** future"". We all agreed to letting her use the money to purchase a permanent home, the investment made sense since we were tired of living in and out of rentals. But it was mostly because if we objected she would abandon us or threaten to kill herself. 

After all was said and done, I finally reflected on everything and realized that my own mother basically robbed my trust money. A borderline act of fraud premeditated at my birth. My trust in her is obliterated and it lead to me deciding to destroy my relationship with my mom.

This is my first holiday season alone. I am beyond done with my family. I am in disbelief that my own mother would sabotage my future for her own interests. She got what she wanted. That being said I do not love her. I was loyal to her for 24 years and she got her fucking shopping spree. 

If I am grateful for anything out of all of this, I am grateful for my tribe. They still have my back as a young adult and they have programs that are helping me finish college and get into a career. But all of this makes me sick.  

TLDR; Mother was emotionally abusive, threatened with abandonment throughout childhood, lived most of my live in fear of my mom while my oldest brother beat the shit out of me. I stayed silent about all of it and internalized my suicidal thoughts. Mother also used me for tribal trust money and deceived myself and my brothers into surrendering it to her. So my mom is a deceiving manipulative bitch and my whole life is a money driven lie created by my greedy mom.",depression,Abusive parent story,early life,LD EL1.csv
1.0,"This might be long so I apologize BUT you might find it interesting! Let me know your opinions.

When I was around 8 I had a very vivid experience of auditory hallucinations where I could hear two men screaming and arguing with each other over where to place a brick. I was wide awake and in my head I was picturing two construction workers arguing. Although I was picturing this image in my head, i could physically hear the shouts so much that I covered my ears with my hands and went “LALALALALA” to drown the sound out and when my brother asked what I was doing I was confused that he didn’t hear the men shouting. 

Around a year later, the same thing happened. This time I didn’t have any image in my head at all, but it was the same screaming male voice demanding that I pass him a pillow. I couldn’t actually picture him there in my room but somehow I understood that he was across the room bc I got angry at the yelling and I sat up in bed and threw my pillow across the room and then the screaming stopped. I did not recognize this voice as someone I knew, but I didn’t question it either and I was not scared either time. Well, the first time I was stressed out because the shouting was too much tbh but the second time I was just really annoyed that he was asking for a pillow and I wanted him to shut up.

Whats weird is that both of the times that this happened I was not confused as to what was happening like I didn’t question the screaming voices at all, as if it was a normal occurrence. The second time it happened I remember realizing what had just happened and feeling confused after the screaming stopped but nothing much came out of it. 

Both of the times this happened I was laying in bed at night to go to sleep but I 100% was not dreaming because my brother reacted to me reacting to the screams both times. I also was not drifting to sleep both times that this happened, I was just laying in bed but not yet tired. 
I’ve never had any other experience like this since then, and im still confused as to wtf that was.

Also this got very long, so at the end is a TLDR, but I'd really appreciate it if you could read the whole thing, as it explains the problem a lot better.

About me, I am 22 years old, still in school, and in a relationship. I have diagnosed pre-existing conditions, but I am not sure if they are responsible for this problem I am experiencing. I am diagnosed with PTSD due to childhood abuse, and depression.

When I was around 16 I dropped out of school because of my problems, I just could not handle the tiniest bit of stress anymore at that point. Even just leaving my room became to much, to a point that my family had to leave me food in front of my door, leave and only then I could take it. I basically couldn't leave my room for almost three years. 

I got help then, by a woman that would come over once a week, and she'd basically slowly establish contact and would train me to leave my room again, slowly step by step. Eventually with her help I was able to enroll in a school that was basically to build me up to get back to a real normal school again. I got accepted by that school, and am now doing my best there.

But here is where my problem starts. I am not a psychologist, so I can not say it with certainty, but in those 3 years of total isolation, I would basically satisfy my social needs by imagining relationships with all these fictional characters I liked, imagining them being there, supporting me, or just talking to me. I feel like maybe this was some sort of self protection for my brain to at least pretend that I was with people. Over time it became so real. I'd cry if something would happen to them as if they were my real friends, I'd have ""relationships"" with some.

But having this need to have them as my companions meant I would spend literal weeks digging up ANYTHING and I mean anything about them. From everything canon to their story to fan created things, everything. Just so I could have as human of a relationship with the as possible. Any info not available I'd fill in myself. I probably knew all of them better than any real person ever. It got to a point that I'd have actual fights with them, moral or political disagreements. It was ridiculous.

I did something very similar as a small child too, when  I was neglected, or I was hurt, I'd imagine these characters helping or comforting me. I also have a very vivid imaginations, so if I concentrate I can literally ""see"" them in the room with me.

When ever I'm mentally well, they basically fade into the background. I can focus on and interact with people and life relatively normally. But whenever I start feeling lonely, or overly stressed I get sucked into this sort of bubble, every thing feels surreal, and dreamlike, except them, despite me knowing they are the ones who aren't real. 

It is extremely hard for me to interact with real life people, or leave my house in this state. I basically just have to hang in there, isolate myself and wait until they go away on their own. This state usually stays for about 2 days up to a week, and I feel totally helpless while it's happening. I know this must be some kind of maladaptive coping mechanism, either from childhood or from when I was isolated, but I have friends now, and even a partner. And now the thing that kept me sane once is getting in my way now.

One thing I want to really stress though is that at no point did I think they were real people, or actually there with me. Like I don't believe Finn from Adventure Time just magically materialised in my room or something XD

I know the best thing would be to get professional help, but I have been struggling with finding anyone. My family supports me and tried helping me find a therapist, but literally everywhere we call they can't take new patients, or only work with specific kinds of clients and so on. 

Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading :)

I'm a survivor of child abuse, and ever since then I'd imagine to interact with fictional characters to help me cope, when I was 16 I was isolated from basically everyone for 3 years which made this way worse.

I had an overall okay childhood.. but until around 10-13 my mom became an alcoholic and ruined my families life, she was insane and a lot of bad expirences with her have emotionally scarred me, she also had multiple mental illnesses and i havent been able to forgive her for the abuse and shit she said to me. It feels like im lying to myself idk, she cheated on my dad which really made me hurt and pissed. i havent been happy.

1.0,"Hello Everyone! 

This is my first time ever using Reddit so I’m not sure how it all works yet, so go easy on me please! 

I had a pretty hard childhood and I thought I’d share some of my experiences. 

I was ten years old when my mom had a complete mental breakdown, and I was there to witness the whole thing. My life changed forever on that day. It took years before she got a diagnosis (paranoid schizophrenic) and even after that, she still didn’t believe she was actually sick. I got taken out of my mom’s home and placed in my grandma’s home, whose wife is bi-polar. So moving from schizophrenia to bi-polar was not much of a relief for me at all. I spent four years living with my two grandmas while my mom suffered through the worst of her illness. She was sent to group homes, and hospitalized, and the male attention she was attracting was getting dangerous. It wasn’t until I was about 17 that my mom got stable on medication and came to terms with her illness. 

To top all of that off, my parents divorced when I was just a baby because my father has been addicted to meth since he was in high school and my mom couldn’t stick around and watch him screw up my life. My father has been in and out of jail my entire childhood and I can just about count on one hand how many times I’ve seen him in my life. 

It was a very traumatic childhood. 

If you’re interested in reading more about my life with all of that craziness and how I survived, I recently started a blog called Distressed and Distracted. Growing up, I never met anyone else who had a life like mine and I have felt so alone in the world for years. Now that I’m an adult, I wanted to share my story and hopefully help and connect with other people who have had a rough go at it too.

1.0,"I don’t even know how to say this concisely. I don’t know whether or not I’m exaggerating past events or if I’m overreacting. I don’t remember anything good from my childhood although I’m certain I was spoiled. My parents gave me whatever I wanted, and I know this as a fact because I have an insane collection of kid’s toys in the basement.
But I don’t remember any of that. All I remember are the times when I ‘disobeyed’ or ‘disrespected’ or ‘hurt his feelings’ and I was physically attacked or called insane. 
But it’s not as if being hit by a parent is uncommon in my community, although I doubt my high school friends had their parents punch them backwards down the stairs. 

Anyway, most of the physical stuff was about 4 or 5 years ago (I have a terrible memory), and although he still has outbursts of anger I’m confident he won’t ever hit me again. He stresses that he’s sacrificed a lot for me, and it’s true. My university tuition is expensive because I’m an international student, and he’s paying for all of it. He buys me gifts sometimes without me asking, and I’ve never felt deprived, materially speaking.

I needed closure about a month ago and I confronted him about the past. He refused to apologize and he became furious. He said that I had said things that hurt his feelings.

And yet I consider suicide almost every month. I'm going to therapy nearly every week, but during every visit I say that I'm doing fine. Why, you may ask? Because I'm afraid of being ""found out"". I feel like a fraud for feeling this awful, because I really have no reason to feel awful. I've never been diagnosed with anything and I doubt that I ever will be. Everybody feels down and nervous sometimes, right? So there's no way that I could be depressed or anxious, because I'm still functioning normally after all.

     About my parents being supportive...I really don't think they, nor my friends, really see how down I really am. When I first told my homeroom teacher about my self harm in middle school, who then contacted my parents, they were furious. No, they weren't concerned. They were angry that I was hurting myself, because in their minds my life is going just fine. This reminded me of the day when my mom read about Chester Bennington's suicide. She turned to me and said: ""At least he had an actually difficult childhood."" After this, I've never talked about any of my struggles with her, because obviously she didn't think that anything going on in my life was bad enough to warrant any sympathy from her. When I started going to therapy, and my dad had to go meet my therapist, I asked him what they talked about. He just snapped at me and said: ""It's pretty obvious why you're going there,"" clearly talking about my cutting. This confirmed that he didn't feel sympathy towards me either.

     I know this has just been a mess, but yeah, no matter how awful I feel, I don't think I deserve therapy.

Many memories haunt me. Being pelted by pinecones in my early years of school, being isolated and treated like a clown for a good part of my childhood while clinging to anyone I could, my father yelling and interrogating me every Saturday, being hit by a car and my leg being broken, the constant nights of crying myself to sleep, the nearly mentally breaking stress of freshman year that was the ultimate culmination of what I consider to be my depression, and the ultimate abandonment by my Dad's side of the family along with my father refusing to go halfsies on dental work.  


Some of these memories even cause me physical pain when I remember them. I am not suicidal by any stretch, nor do I self harm, but I feel if I died tomorrow the only thing I'd feel sad about is my mother's feelings. I feel barely grounded to reality, as if I am a ghost. I have no consistent friends online, no group, no people. IRL I only have 2 friends, and they have served me greatly throughout the years. Without them I would have probably kicked my own bucket before now.  


It feels like the past years have been nothing but a blur, a facade, a dream. I would not be surprised if this is only a cheap simulation, though the chances of it being so are quite unlikely and probably not the case.   


It's hard to describe my mental state. I can go from optimistic and full of courage to a shell of a human being in a few days. I feel as if someone is pressing at the back of my eyes and squeezing my heart. I feel depressed at times though I have no courage to actually see if I have it, for fear of not actually having it... If I don't, I don't really think I'd feel sane anymore. Perhaps it's just teenage hormones, but I've felt this way even before this. The only thing I have to combat this is, of course, weed which I use in moderation. I barely even cry anymore I've been so desensitized, or at least that's as best as I can put it.  


I have no distraction nor outlet except for the internet. I have no affinity for physical things such as sports and other things, nor any other group where I have to socialize, though I have improved my personality and speaking quite a bit through this past year. I have practically no motivation either and simply avoid my problems by staying cooped up in my room and staying on the internet.  


I only have one single hope. I have been thinking of maybe working up the courage to speak to my school councilor and getting a referral to a medical professional to diagnose me with something so I can at least understand what I'm fighting, but I have no hope for therapy or any of that. My mother has tried getting me it through the Canadian government for free to no avail, so we can't afford any therapy, especially with COVID.

I remember having to act as a parent to my younger brother at times when they were fighting, because my parents were to upset to be there for me or my brother. 

One time I remember us driving somewhere, but my parents got in a fight and my dad abruptly stopped the car. He went out and told us he would let a car run over him, even though it didn’t happen and probably wasn’t going to. I ran out of the car too, and told him that if he did that, I’d do it too. 

My parents calmed down a bit after that, but my mom was still crying. We were going to a restaurant, and we all had to pretend we were fine. I was comforting my mom, and my brother was comforting my dad. It was one of the worst moments in my life. I was probably around 11 or 12 years old.

My parents really fought a lot more back then. They stopped fighting a bit after I developed my eating disorder (2 years ago, I was 13).

My parents really fought a lot growing up, and I had to take the parent role multiple times. Now I’m just numb to screaming and fighting, I no longer react strongly to yelling.

I am 29 now, and one of four siblings. I am the oldest which meant that I took the brunt of things growing up, helping raise my younger siblings while my mom was out drinking or in a mental hospital and while my dad, the most selfless and hardworking man I know, was making a living for my family. Somehow my brothers and sisters ended up just fine and we are all extremely close which I am so grateful for.

The thing funny thing is, I wouldn't change a thing. My struggles have shaped me and I am a stronger and more well-rounded person because of what I've been through. However, only my very close friends and family know this fact about me. It's like I have been keeping a large part of myself a secret, and I long open up and share my true, authentic self with everyone. I want to help end the stigma but I know I have to own it myself, first. This is the first step.",mentalhealth,"I'm 29 and have been diagnosed with bipolar for 7 years.

I  switched between the acute facility and the ""normal one"" and spend about a half year in there. I started to get used to it to everyday being the same and being shut off from all the other shit. Now after being out for two years with no SH relapse I'm doing pretty ok. I'm not really depressed anymore,only at the evening or if I stayed sober the whole day. The only thing I really struggled with is anxiety. My parent and everyone else thinks I'm pretty much healed and I don't want to ruin this impression as I know how it affected them and their psyche as well. Once my dad drove me in the same city the psychiatrie was in and he just started crying which he never does. If it wasn't for them I definitely would've gone back there at least once.

Even tough I resisted the urge to cut for two years winter depression and quarantine drove me to scratch open my upper leg and it felt gorgeous. I didn't use a blade as I knew I couldn't leave it at a few cuts then. The thing is I don't really feel this big time depression as before,more a wave of nostalgia because that time and the year or two before going there are pretty much the only thing I remember from my childhood. I try to clinge to these memories and try to wake the feelings I felt back then. Back then I really didn't enjoy most of it but now at least it was somehow fulfilling unlike whatever state I'm at now. I often try to make myself cry, but I just can't. There's nothing I wish for more than a good cry or being able to cut myself without consequences.

1.0,"its about time i came clean.... i have made a few posts before but i think its time to tell you all where this battle began........  


my depression battle began back in 2002, im in high school \[secondary school as im in the UK\]  
I was a bully victim not a normal Bully Victim \[i am going to get a shit ton of hate for this\] in the first year i was the ONLY white kid in year 7 so i was already an outsider, in their eyes, mentally beaten before the actual BEATINGS began.......  


after a year of this, i ended up at a psychotherapist, who which i never knew was some one who can see into the spiritual mind \[if you believe in that sort of thing, but im open minded when it comes to that sort of thing\]  
they even said that this is not trauma, its the beginning of a clinical depression battle thanks to those who bullied me for being white \[AGAIN this is 2002-2003\]   


as time moved on after getting Expelled from that shit hole, i was improving had a few girlfriends relationships did not work out, then we move to 2010 i ended up meeting some one who i thought was the one. was a good relationship for a time 3 years dating then on the 13th of may 2013 while we was on holiday \[vacation for everyone else\] i popped ""the question"" on a stage of a show we was seeing, while they was on a break \[Luckily the person running the show was a friend of mine\]

She said yes i was happy, for fucking once in my miserable existence i was happy..... then only 10 months later.... what felt like i was stabbed by a blunt one handed broad sword, by some prick who decides fate. my grand father dies. \[he stayed around while i was in that god damn hospital... i was in there for 12 fucking hours after i had the call he was there\]   


after i got back to the shit pit i called a home at the time... 20 minutes passed, i had the phone call i DID NOT want to hear..... my grand father passed on, i snapped inside punching every wall, Door and window, bloody was dripping on my floor before my Fiancé at the time came home after she heard what happen....  


i began pushing EVERYONE away since.... in my teen age years me and my dad's relationship was rocky \[typical alpha male bullshit\] but even he knew how close i was to my grand father \[just to clarify my grandfather in this post is my moms side, to this day i have NEVER met my dads father\]  


after the funeral, this is where the depression hit a new low and when i say new low every December \[being it would be my grandfathers birthday\] And i caught that bitch of an ex fiancé cheat on me with a prick my hometown knew as a wrongen as he is known as a child rapist....... yes my fiancé \[GF\] cheated on me with a god damn pedophile... i was angry, willing to do 25 years to life for beating the bastard in more ways than most can imagine...   


ever since then i have hated the month of december and end up intaking more alcohol then i normally would...... my grandfather birthday shares they day i cuaght that thing sleep with some one so disgusting that a day in hell is a vacation

1.0,"Trigger warning this is a a true story about me, and deals with some heavy shit if you’re not ready to hear about it please don’t read this. My whole life I’ve been depressed, that probably isn’t true but it feels like it. As far back as I can recall I’ve been unhappy with myself. It all started when I was 10 and a man who I’ll call J came into my life.he was my mother’s boyfriend, and I quickly learn that his sexual interests extended past my mom and to me. After a mouth of him being in my life the light assault turned to full blown rape ever other day. He was a alcoholic and at the time so was my mother, meaning she never noticed it happening. And for some reason I never tried informing her of it, to this day she still doesn’t have any idea of the mental, sexual, and physical abuse I went through on a daily basis. I think I don’t want to tell her because I’m embarrassed of it, but that’s besides the point. His magnum opus of abuse was during a holiday. Every summer when I was a kid we would try to leave our city and go somewhere nice to relax. This instance we decided to go to a place called Vancouver in Britain Columbia Canada. My mother and brother came along with us but we got separate rooms, my brother with my mom and me with J. One night he drove back after a long night of drinking and cheating on my mom. He was absolutely hammered. He came to my room and woke me up and said he wanted to “play a game”. I knew what this means it’s his code word for fucking me. I don’t know what time it was exactly but outside it was quite blue. So it must of been 3-5 in the morning. Needless to say I wasn’t really that exited to “play” but I knew if I said no I would get beaten, so I without saying anything stood up and got ready. Without going into to much detail he started making me suck his cock, I instinctively started biting down due to the pain it caused. He ripped me off and started yelling at me about how he’s going’s to kill me but not before he rapes and murders my mother in front of me. He stormed out of the room and I thought maybe I got away with it, but a minute or so later he comes back in with a knife, pins me down and presses it to my chest. He tells me that I’ll finish what I started or he’ll rip my heart out. (I’m sorry if I rushed true that but it’s difficult to talk about for me) And so I did. After that instance I didn’t talk for a mouth, but the abuse didn’t stop. One day well I was sitting alone on the playground I got called to the office and I was informed that J had overdosed and died. You would think this would make me happy but for some reason I felt attached to him, like it was my fault he’s dead. Since this whole ordeal I was never the same, in a Attempt to feel better about myself I started eating. It was my only coping method, I had no friends and I definitely couldn’t talk to my family about it as my mom was still in love with J. So I got fat and as soon as the abuse at home stopped the abuse at school started, I was called balloon boy and many other insults and slurs. Then high school started, I was never very smart so I was put in a “bridging class” basically I wasn’t dumb enough to go to a special school, but I wasn’t smart enough to go to normal classes. The good news was I actually started making friends we would skip class and smoke weed and talk about all the women we fucked when we all knew none of us have even had our first kiss. Somehow these kids got me involved with the “cool kid” and this is most likely the worst thing to ever happen to me. Two people stood out from the rest of them I’ll call them joe and John. Joe stood out because of how nice he was to me, instantly I felt like he could be my best friend. But John stood out because of how much he reminded me of my now deceased stepfather. Immediately he started abusing me he would had to hangout with me just so he could get me drunk and start beating me, anytime I would find I woman I like he would go tell her horrible lies about me or make a fake account with my name and message vulgar racist things just to make sure I couldn’t be happy. No joke at one point he told Joe that the reason he was so awful to me is because he thought it would be funny if I killed myself because of him. This continued for years up to the recent quarantine, I thought it was all over. This was my last year and if I never had to go back to school I would never have to see him again. Life for a while was good my mom stopped drinking and stated smoking weed. I got a new step dad and he’s great and my mom even started buying me weed. After about a mouth of being trapped inside with my mother I started to open up to her about what I’ve been feeling and I got put on medicine to help with my adhd depression and my anxiety. But this moment of happiness would last as we after a bit went back to school, it seems that John wanted to make up for lost time of abuse. And it ramped up tenfold, it was also at this time I found out that my stepdad cheated on my mom and with my mom having a void were he used to be she filled it with liquor. And so did I there was so much booze in the house she would notice if I stole some, and I became very dependent on it. It was around this time my suicidal thoughts started getting heavier. And to top it all off Joe my best friend overdosed and died at 17 years old. And that leads us to now. I started cutting not just cutting but burning myself with a lighter  punching brick walls and a multitude of other ways to hurt myself. My suicidal thoughts are only getting worse and I have no one to talk to. If you made it this far than hopefully you can help me with my problems I don’t even know why I hurt myself, it’s just makes me feel a escape. I am concerned that one day I’m going to kill my self and I don’t know what to do.",mentalhealth,I started cutting,Early life,LD EL1.csv
1.0,"My fear of being abandoned is weighing hard on my life right now. I hate that it affects me as much as it does. I’m in a relationship with a wonderful girl who I love very much, and even then, it still causes problems for me. 

I’m not trying to say I had the worse life - all things considered, my life really wasn’t bad at all. My parents divorced when I was 7 years old. I went from seeing my dad everyday to seeing him twice a month. I remember hiding in the back of his car when he’d drop me off of my mom’s house. I remember crying everyday and every minute at school after I moved. I remember hiding in the house each morning to try and avoid going to school just because I wanted to cry. 

My mom sent me to therapy after a few months, and after that I started doing a lot better. And like I said, I didn’t have the worst life or anything but there was some problems. 

From what I’ve told therapists and other people, I grew up in an abusive and neglectful household, though I didn’t feel it at the time. Alcoholics, drug using, and just narcissistic parents.  You know the drill. 

I remember my visiting my dad during certain weekends and him getting drunk and telling me to never come back. I remember when my mom fought my first stepdad over medication and the cops come over. I remember when my stepdad killed himself weeks later when my mom stopped wanting to see him. 

I remember when my aunt took me in and for the first time I felt like I had a mother. I’ll always remember the phone call I got when I found out she passed away from a heart attack. 

Everyone always leaves me. Or I always isolate and push people away before they do. I’ll find a reason to make myself the bad guy and then repulse others from me.

1.0,"I don’t know how to start this or even where to start. I have been really struggling . At the moment it feels as if i dont deserve the good things in my life.

My brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and I’m worried what it means about me and my life and whether or not I'm as good as other people or worthy enough to be alive. In a moment of stupidity I shut the door and encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didn’t last long a 30 seconds, maybe I don’t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second that’s that was ok or even an option mortifies me. I am terrified it makes me a monster akin to people who abuse and molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent, it makes me feel as though I don’t deserve to live and suicide constantly rattled around my head as my only release.

I hate that I ruined my life story. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I cant have any self esteem or positive image of myself.

In all other regards i was a normal teen. Other than being anxious and a little depressed. its just this weird thing i did which is horrible.

1.0,"I'm a 16 year old male, and for the first time, I'm truly ready to die.

In the past, I've had suicidal thoughts. I've attempted a few times, but quickly stopped from fear. But I feel like I'm ready to die now.

My mental health is in freefall, and I feel completely lost. I feel like that's a big misconception about depression. For me, the world isn't crashing and burning around me - the world is fine. I'm the one that's crashing.

I've tried to cope in many different ways over the past few years - self harm, self poisoning, hurting my body against objects, eating too much, eating too little, etc. Hell, I even had a masturbation addiction at one point. I hate that I couldn't stop myself from doing these things, but I understand why I did them - to transform emotional pain to physical pain.

I don't trust my parents. Whenever someone is upset in my house (which is mainly me), they immediately get annoyed. I tried to open up to them in the past but it's like they're completely unfeeling towards it, even trying to avoid talking about it at all. I remember one time I self harmed and didn't try to hide it. I guess that was my way of going ""please, PLEASE notice me. Please, see what is happening. I need your help."" But when my parents saw, all they did was scold me for it. They called me childish and said I was only doing it for attention. In a way, I guess I was.

I just wanted them to listen. Whenever I mess up, it's all verbal insults. Recently, I started sixth form, and to avoid my ever-darkening thoughts, I buried myself in work, completing notes for a 2-year A-Level course in the timespan of 6 days. My parents kept saying I should have a work-life balance, so I started playing Minecraft while on call with my friends. They didn't like that. They started calling me lazy, and saying I do nothing anymore. I didn't know what to think, or how to feel anymore. Whenever I try to go up to my room throughout the day, they get mad, saying I disappear. They make me spend as much of the day downstairs with them as possible, but we don't do anything together. Except when we're forced to watch movies together EVERY NIGHT. They don't even care about what I want.

To clarify, I live in a family of 6, and have 3 siblings. I'm the oldest, and so am forced to look after them. This is fine, but it's like my parents expect me to be their full-time parent, and they barely do anything anymore. My sisters are 5 and 6 years old, and I'm expected to help them with all their homework. My brother, who is 12, has autism. I am also expected to help him with any work he has. Along with this, I have chores. A lot of them. I do the dishes, hoovering the house (which is reasonably large), do all the dust, clean the bathrooms, wash the outside of both my parent's cars, along with hoovering the inside of the cars. I have to cut the grass in the garden, along with shower my sisters, and hoover downstairs every single day. I do not get paid for this, but I never expected to get paid for helping my family. My problem is that they don't do anything to help me, instead scolding me when I accidentally mess up, or if I haven't cleaned properly.

I can't take this responsibility anymore, along with all the work I have from school, and all the exams I have to prepare for. It's too much.

I've tried to speak to my parents about this, but, as you might have guessed by now, all they do is get angry with me and punish me even more - taking away my phone and laptop, the second of which I actually need for my homework and studying. They don't care.

I know I'm not perfect - I'd argue I'm on the worse side of humanity. I find myself getting angry quite easily, along with panicked. When my sisters start arguing with me or lying, I get really stressed and angry, often arguing or shouting back. The same goes for my 12 year old brother. We get into fights, with him taunting me or hitting me, and I hit back, but I hit back hard (due to me being older). I feel terrible for it. I tend to self harm whenever I do - as punishment.

I've tried to talk about some of this to my parents, but they get mad at me. So, naturally, I decided to confide in my close friends.

I don't hang around many people. 5 or 6 of the people I talk to I would consider my friends, but I only have 3 close ones. One of them, when I talked to about this, sympathized, and understood more than most. But, over time, I was constantly being reminded how I'm doing better off than most people, yet I'm still complaining about life. It hurts even more because what he is saying is true, and I have no excuse for that. Another friend, one which I considered my closest for a long time, was told by me about my self harm and depression. She started making me promise to not do it, on the condition that if I did, she would stop eating, or hurt herself. I've grown apart from her, which I'm glad. I can't deal with that anymore, making empty promises, and hurting people when I inevitably break them. The last of my close friends doesn't know about any of this. They only noticed I self harmed, but only brought it up once. I don't want to tell them though. I know if I will, they'll see me differently, and I can't do that anymore - not to myself, and not to them, either.

I hardly sleep anymore. Whenever things go quiet, my suicidal thoughts and urge to self harm return. That's why I try to keep my mind busy at all times. When I'm doing something, I like to have my phone playing anything in the background, just so it distracts me more and more. I can't sleep easily, but I also sleep too much afterwards. It's all a vicious cycle, and my parents are getting more and more mad with me, and I hate myself more and more for disappointing them every day.

I know that if I keep on living, I'll end up hurting myself, or someone else. I can't afford to keep hurting people. I just want to die, and move on, anywhere.

I take medication for Raynaud's, which also doubles as high blood pressure medication. Since I have trouble sleeping, there would be no trouble me getting sleeping pills prescribed. Obviously, I'll try them a few days beforehand, to test how strong they are, and how long the effects are. Then, on a night where I know I won't be disturbed, I will take more high blood pressure medication than I should - this should slow my body's functions, even if it is a little bit. Then, I will take more than enough sleeping medication, and go to bed, with a plastic bag wrapped around my head via rubber bands, or something of the sort. I will wear a cap so that the bag doesn't stick to my face, and have a large enough bag so that I pass out before I lose oxygen.

I'll leave my suicide note on my desk, which would only contain me telling my family and friends how much I loved them, and how sorry I am - I won't be mentioning any of this thread, etc. I will then fall asleep, and eventually run out of oxygen, at which point my brain will begin decaying, and I will eventually die due to cerebral hypoxia. A peaceful end, and a quiet one too. The body would be mostly preserved.

I don't expect anyone to read all of this, but if you have, thank you. Truly. You've already done more than my family or friends ever have. I tried to talk to everyone, I've tried every option. I've tried self destructive methods like self-poisoning, self harming, not eating, eating a lot, sleeping too much, not sleeping, etc. I've tried ""normal"" methods such as therapy, opening up, but nothing has worked, and I believe it's far too late for me.

I'm just so lost, and I feel like death is my only escape. Even if it wasn't, I feel like it's the preferable option.

If there's anything you could say to help, or to give advice on, please do. I don't want sympathy, I just want to know if there's any better alternatives than death in my current situation. I just want to be at peace, and I'm sorry you've ever had to read this.",SuicideWatch,I'm not sure what to do anymore,Early life,LD EL1.csv

Making me pick up a porn addiction bc I wasnt allowed to socialize outside my religious circle in the mosque and made me wear a headscarf at 12 until age 23 so that id be bullied by my peers. Never letting me wear makeup, dress like a woman, or act feminine. Never letting me buy anything without complaining, calling me 50 times a day when i finally leave the house, expecting me to have been married at 23. Waking me up to pray every morning at 6 am. Looking at my texts, phone calls,and messages as an adult. Never letting me be financially independent. Sending me off to another country for year even though I said no. Threatening me. Gaslighting me. Making me cry multiple times. Making me share a room with my sister until I was 21. 

Giving me food, water, a roof, education, and decent clothes and calling that everything I need but not emotional support.

When I was 7 my parents divorced.

Afterwards I was diagnosed with severe depression and tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 9.

Not that anyone bothered.

""Stop trying to grab attention"" ""Just be happy"" ""Just get over it""

My grades started dropping and I was sent to a mental facility after a violent outburst at age 10.

When I was 12 I was sent to a house where troubled teens could live. Criminals. Who did hard drugs. I didn't need something like that, I needed a psychiatrist.

Half a year later I was sent to a place akin to a boot camp. There I was raped 6 times, which is also how I discovered that I was bisexual.

 I'm currently living in a shared flat where teens with eating disorders get the help they need. But I don't have the strength to go on.

I'll try and tell my story to the best of my ability.

As an elementary schooler, I was angry and violent. The littlest things set me off into rage and I'd fight other kids on the playground who annoyed me in the slightest. I'd flip chairs and attack teachers in retaliation of having to work. The violence was partially fueled by actual pure rage and an early videogame addiction that I am still yet to beat. I'd imagine myself a monster and fantasized about shooting up the school. Part of the outlet for these rage fantasies was my sister. She seemed to make me furious every day and every day I would beat her and beat her and scar her over and over again.

Middleschool helped reduce the violence because of the new threat of real punishment for assault, but it was never fully gone. Puberty hit me like a truck. Or more like a sedan with a boost engine. As a middleschooler I had no control over myself. My sexuality was off the walls. I gained a porn addiction very quickly and am still far far from getting anywhere close to beating it. At some point in the summer of 6th grade I had coerced my much younger sister to have sex with me and was on the verge of going through with it but was nearly caught by my dad checking in on us in my room, stopping me. If it weren't for that coincidence I would've raped her far worse than I already have. I was literally inches away from inserting it. I'm convinced I traumatized her and it makes me feel guilty just seeing her every day and constantly being reminded of the toll of my sins. I ruined my own sisters life because I just can't control myself, sexually or emotionally.

Middleschool also marked the end of a lot of my old friendships and in a weird attempt to fit in I chose to act out weirdly and sexually. I told hundreds and hundreds of people about the sister story and carried it around like a badge of honor until I realized it was something to be ashamed of. The entire damn school knew me as the creepy pedophile idiot who annoys everyone and I still carry remnants of that reputation with me today and it's so painful. Everyone hates me and I'm avoided like the plague.

Highschool freshman year was the start of my real depression. I started realizing my world was falling apart around me. I thought my reputation was funny and cool but when it set in it set in hard. The guilt for the sister situation was strong. I started collecting child p*rn and kept it up for nearly a year before my parents discovered it and deleted it all. I knew what I was doing was wrong but kept doing it anyways. I truly came to the conclusion that I was an incel and I still stand by that today. I'm an incel. My middleschool love life was pathetic. I really only dated one girl named zoe and ruined it with her when I groped her without her permission. Years later now we're close friends but the torment of guilt of hurting yet another person because of my urges weighed on me heavily at that time. The closest I got to a relationship after that was several love notes that each got systematically rejected one by one. I've had 2 recent relationships since then, one with a guy named Dawson and another named Madison, who both broke up with me after seeing me in person and never gave real explanations for why they did. I know I'm ugly and thats why. I'm irredeemably ugly. Not just physically, but mentally. I'm a horrible person and I hurt everyone around me without regard or control. 

The closest I came to happiness was with madison. She seemed so perfect for me. I felt truly loved for once. I spent every hour of my day talking to her. I loved her with everything I had. Then we met in person. The next day she broke up with me. It was my longest relationship and yet it only lasted a month. I was torn apart. My world was ruined. I cried and cried every night. Eventually I decided to finally do it, I was gonna wait until I was home alone and then shoot myself. I told madison beforehand my plan and gave her my goodbyes and I told her I loved her. She managed to get into contact with my parents on facebook and thus I was prevented from being home alone. My parents forced me into therapy which I've always hated. I've had suicide ideation nearly every day since then but am yet to make a serious plan. However, I did write a note which is no longer relevant and I should rewrite. 

Madison and I tried to be friends after the whole ordeal. I still loved her deep down but held it in and focused on just being her friend. But I got annoying and she got mad and she blocked me on everything. I wad devastated again. I was suicidal once again for several days. Ever since I've been using games as a coping method and have been disossaciating from close friends and am slowly but surely burning my friendships away that I've spent so much hard work building. I'm no longer capable of being a good friend. I'm worthless and a burden. My life should just end now.",SuicideWatch,I'm 15 and my life is a blight on myself and others,Early life,LD EL1.csv

My mother was raped when my biological father was high on drugs. The only reason why I was born was because she was in poverty and couldn't afford to get an abortion. Luckily though he died when I was 6. What hurts even more is that I have autism. My mother resents me for it, wishing I was never born instead of being cursed with a mentally handicapped child. School wasn't much better, lots of relentless bullying. One of my teachers used to work with my mom and has a grudge against her, and used it to take it out on me in class. My first attempt was in 7th grade. Between 7th grade and graduating high school I tried to commit suicide 18 times. Then I tried to go to college, and attempted another 5. After college was when I got my first taste of how despicable things were. My first job was at a local rec center. I was a custodian. Worked very early hours and the building was mostly full of retired people. None of them respected me. I was treated like a slave and lesser human being because of my inability to socialize and timid nature. Many of them called me homophobic slurs as well because of my naturally swooped hair. They also called my black coworker racist slurs but besides the point. 
Now, im 24, depressed, anxiety ridden, not high functioning enough to work a decent job, not high functioning enough to drive a car, stuck with my step father who's only personality trait is complaining about politics and why im such a pathetic loser over things I can't control. What pushed me to the edge most recently is my insurance dumping my medication. I cantbafford any of it anymore.

It was to the point where I washed my face with soap, and drank and sniffed soap mixed with water, cause I thought it would stop me from getting infected. But according to him, I was just acting cause I was too lazy to go to school, and when I was terrified that I couldn't sleep, he yelled at me and told me that I'm just doing it for sympathy, going so far as to parody me. And my mom is so over worried that it's more like me who has to take care of her, than her having to take care of me. When I'm home, I have to stay up at night cause she can't stand me laying in bed with suicidal thoughts. I told her that I'm not gonna act on it for the night, still won't let me rest. It doesn't help that she called me a ticking timebomb, and telling me that I was dumb for doing drugs, like it's just fucking easy to stop. When I took 'a gram of speed, I was cured for 6 hours - that's a long time when you're in misery most the time. I've been sober for six months just so my abuse wouldn't hurt them, no appreciation from my dad whatsoever. When I try to explain to them that I lose control cause the pain is too much, they just look at me like I'm coming up with bad excuses. According to my dad, I just lack willpower, like he is rational 24/7, even though he smashed our computer just cause the printer wouldn't work.

They are not bad parents, and they've also done a lot of good for me, but gosh, I'd just wish they'd realize that they can't help me as long as they can't understand what I'm going through. I'm not gonna rationalize it anymore just cause they want the best, they are one of the reasons I'm this fucked up. I just wish I could go back in time and make some other sperm cell fertilize that egg, so they'd get someone who wouldn't a genetic freak like me, so they could be happy, and I could not exist.

1.0,"I’ll give you a list of evidence that proves I am and have always been beyond saving.


A girl in 1st grade didn’t like me. When she moved, she let everyone in the classroom hug her except me.


In 2nd grade, I got beat up by the class tard. Yes, the CLASS TARD. The kid who once announced that he shat himself during class. The kid who was genuinely weird.


I had frequent crushes throughout school and would approach girls in cringy and creepy ways.


In 3rd grade, I cried during tag and the kids who I played with told me they were not my friend anymore.


I was the recipient of the oreo game in 6th grade (look it up)


In middle school, I loudly repeated my childhood best friend’s joke in such a way that embarrassed both of us. We stopped being friends soon afterward.


I got obsessed with being popular in middle and high school. To me, this involved hanging out with friends, going to parties, sleepovers/bonfires, drugs and alcohol, and generally having fun with friends. I did none of that at all.


I tried joining a friend group, but one girl said she was not comfortable being around me. She eventually reported me for touching her, even though I did nothing. I got so angry at her that I leaked her social media and address on the internet. I also did the same to another girl who said she hated me.


This one hurt. In junior year, I had a math class with a girl who I became really good friends with. Unfortunately, she started hanging out with the girl I doxxed, so I got jealous. I became increasingly clingy until she outright told me that I creeped her out and she had to move seats away from me in class. The next year, I paid for a ticket that prompted a list of best friend matches based on a short personality test, and guess who’s name was listed as my best match? That’s right, the same girl that I had creeped out the previous year.


I lasted two weeks at a 4 year college before ending up in a mental hospital because I just couldn’t handle a college social life. 




I have noticed that I am starting to get sucked into the alt right and inceldom, which I have struggled with back in middle/high school. I don’t want to be a nazi or a racist or an incel.


Give me one reason why I should keep going. My dad left, my mom is struggling to make ends meet, and I feel like such a burden on my family and the world. I frequently get glares from women who think i’m staring at them. And to make things worse, I have developed a fear of small children and their screaming (I get anxious around kids and have panic attacks if they scream), making working in most entry level jobs and going anywhere in public unbearable. I feel like there is no end in sight to my misery, and I want to end this cycle of despair. I’m no saint, but surely there is a way I can somehow be redeemed, right?",SuicideWatch,I’m beyond saving at this point,Early Life,LD EL1.csv
1.0,"TL;DR I'm just another number


I'm almost 30. The age at which I said I would allow myself to end it if nothing worked out a kind of self-imposed deadline haha.....  


I honestly thought I could do it, that I could somehow become happy, or at least maintain some kind of balance. I've tried hard, really fucking hard, to be the ""best"" person I can be and honestly I think I achieved that It's just that even at my best I'm not worth it.


Growing up my life was hell, both my parents were alcoholics my Dad was just in general neglectful there were only like three times where we would interact the first being him shouting or hitting me when he got too drunk, the second and I've never figured out why he would drop me off and pick me up from school something he was adamant about which more of than not resulted in me being late everyday and sometimes waiting for up to two hours for him to come pick me up and lastly he was a big fan of junk food sometimes he would get drunk and let me eat with him which was probably the highlight of my childhood. My ""mother"" on the other hand just seemed to hate me just thinking about her used to give me panic attacks. It seemed like her goal was to knock out all the types of abuse she could and the worst thing was her smile and laughter throughout it all. I could write a whole page out of the shit she used to do to me from the hitting, kicking, slapping, scratching, spitting, choking, pricking me with needles to making me eat burnt food/food off the floor to the touching... Also family activites like going out to drink and leaving me in the car.


The abuse I suffered at home made my brain In all its wisdom decide the best way to cope with everything is to eat and i had no shortage of crappy strongly flavoured food at home as you can guess i was fat, extremely fat. You can probably also guess how that went for my school life who doesn't like the ugly, short, shy, awkward, fat kid? yeah, made It feel just like home.


Few years later parents died in a car crash, drinking and driving, and I felt nothing no joy or sadness. Moved in with a uncle I had no idea existed, got into a College, uncle got me a therapist.


My uncle was a high functioning(?) addict In that he had a stable job and people liked him, still he had his mood swings and what not It was heaven compared to before. Also not sure if this is common with addicts, but he would have these moments of extreme clarity, moments where he would talk about his problems and have plans laid out on how to fix them. He would talk to me about his and my dads childhood in those moments and it was much of the same abuse he would call it a cycle and it's why he decided not to have any children. The talks with him were the main reason why I stayed away from alcohol and drugs, addiction seemed to run in the family and It's what killed both of them in the end.


Looking back I can say that my therapist at that time was absolutely horrible I would go to her and tell her about the struggles I would have trying to make friends, control my eating habits, falling behind the rest of the class and she would just repeat some variation of Are you trying your best? and Fake it till you make it. Advice which I took whole heartedly and what ultimately led me to my first suicide attempt. I constantly felt like I wasn't doing my best and kept pushing and pushing untill I snapped It was completely on impulse I took a bunch sleeping pills and whatever other pills I could find and cut myself. I remember parts of it, breathing was incredibly hard as was moving, like my body was becoming numb and heavy and I just kind of drifted off. Woke up in a hospital extremely dizzy and had an intense headache for weeks. It was my uncle that found me, we never really talked about it at all, although he started to make promises of us going to the movies/bowling and other stuff, which never happened because of the addiction. It used to eat him up in his more sober moments and he would say he's sorry, I would tell him it was okay, but to this day I feel like shit knowing I was hurting him.


After the attempt I couldn't eat, I would always throw everything up, but i still found myself trying to eat whenver i felt stressed. On the bright side I lost most of the weight I went from 130 odd kg to 50kg. Did nothing for how I felt about my body because now instead of fat It's all loose skin and stretch marks. Took a few years to get it under control. Lost majority of my hair at this time as well.


Started attending multiple groups every week, was seeing a new therapist, made ""friends"" from said groups, uncle got me a job, started volunteering on top of that, travelled a bit, did a bunch of crap from water painting to skydiving at the behest of my therapist. 


After telling my therapist out of everything I tried, there was nothing that I enjoyed, she told me to just do something to keep myself busy, something I could do to take my mind off things. I settled on exercise thinking it would do something about the way I feel about myself and that it was harder to get distracted than if i was doing something like painting. Started going to the gym had a set schedule but had to stop afer a bad experience, Then i took up bodyweight exercises at home, got pretty damn good at it, I was doing HSPUs, Dragon flags, etc. I thought those achievements would make me happy but no...


Going to work felt like I was back in school but this time the person in charge didn't have to pretend to be nice to you. I hated it, being blamed for things I wasn't taught how to do while others get a free pass, the mocking, anxiety I would get when I had to deal with customers. Just all round horrible.


Damn this is getting long, might as well skip to when I think my spiral back down started. It probably started after this encounter I had with a woman, I was basically laughed out of a bedroom, that drudged up a whole bunch of crap. Saw an old school bully who I decided to confront, to say that I'm still here even after everything they put me through, they had no idea who I was. Had a falling out with my therapist, my uncle passed away. I was reaching the end of my rope so I reached out to my ""friends"" for help, people that I've stayed up talking to all night when I had work the next day, given money to, bought groceries for, picked up their relatives from the airport and so on those ""friends"" who decided they had no time for me when I needed to talk. 


Not sure how much of this makes sense but yeah... originally i wanted to get this shit all of my chest and talk to someone, anyone who could relate in anyway but as I was writing this It just cemented my original plan.

I isolated myself. made no friends. experienced nothing. then senior year studied abroad.

the study abroad was in a developing country and broke my spirit. the director was cruel, the cohort cutthroat competitive, and my host family strictly dieted and emotionally abused me.

after that I went to college at one of the best schools. I love this school. I felt happy for the first time, away from an unhappy household. 

on the first day I met a girl who became my best friend. we did everything together. we went to nyc and it was the happiest three days of my life. I did anything for this girl. she said jump, I said how high. 

she would be cold to me sometimes - blow me off, come an hour late to plans, evade questions, silent treatment, wouldn’t text back. she didn’t like me talking to other people or family so I had no friends back then.

she was jealous, controlling, and possessive over me. she lied to other people and exhibited some manipulative behavior. 

she started liking me and asked me to be her gf. we dated and she rushed things when I wanted slow. we had sex a lot. she was obsessed with me and would not leave me alone. I was uncomfortable because it was really intense. 

we planned a trip together and my family bought her tickets ($800). I talked about it to everyone and I’d never looked forward to anything so much in my life.

she cancelled a week before we’d leave. I was so heartbroken I broke up with her. 

my family wanted reimbursement for the tickets and my ex gf screamed at me. I’ve never seen someone so mad, screaming I bought such expensive tickets as revenge. said it was just a trip and I should pay for it. I wish I hadn’t asked.

I was shocked she changed so much, I refused to believe she was bad. I stopped her whenever I saw her, texted her, and showed up to her study spots a few times. 

we had some good conversations where it looked like we’d become friends again, but I kept asking for (in general terms) the truth. she didnt want to tell me and got mad. she told me not to talk to her and blocked me.

I’ve seen her around. I have not talked to her for months. everyone I know hates her, thinks she abused me, and that she’s a psychopath. she has one friend people say she tricked. 

someone told me she wasn’t doing well and asked if I knew. I feel so bad and have been crying for the last couple days. I am so worried about her. there’s nothing I can do because I need to respect her boundary. 

I feel so guilty and sad. she had to block me in the spring! I feel like a monster. she has a rough background. I turned everyone against her because almost no one likes her and even hates her. I feel like I exaggerated things and misrepresented the situation which was a misunderstanding. I must’ve done something that made her act this way.

I don’t think I can ever know the truth and it hurts. I think she’s a good person and want to understand her side of the story.

I'm too apathetic to do anything when I know I'll just die and enter the void of non-existing.

So this happened last year (around september i dont rly remember).I was 15 , in high school  Ive had a friend in my class.We were like brothers and it was the first time ive had someone like that in my life because ive skipped school since lower primary up until high school because of financial problems which also led up to family problems.This gap was also part of the problem.Ive had problems socialising with people and he would help me with that.The class i was in was really toxic.It was crawling with bullies and stuff so naturally i  was a magnet to bullying.He would try to defend me from them.But one time one of them really took it far with me and tried to choke me out , i was tired of it and I dunno how in the world but i slapped the life out of this guy's face like it was some kind of fantasy.His buddies came in and i got some punishment for that.All of this happened while my friend was watching and he was doing nothing.Not even a word did he say to them like before.I was shocked to see him do that but he apologised to me saying he wouldnt make a change even if he was there.I was upset but eventually forgave him.Some time passed on and we were nearing finals exams when i started hearing rumors about my friend , like how he was ""doing things with his sister"" ""smoking"" , many weirder stuff.I wanted to ask him about these but i was scared that he would be upset about it if he misunderstood me for others who are spreading the rumour , so i didnt ask him.So the finals came , Me and Him Passed and We were in the same class again.There were new and old faces in my classroom(they were not toxic like the others).Our new class teacher(ill call her CT)was a very nice person , the whole atmosphere was so different.I was hoping this was the end of everything i suffered last year but i couldnt be more wrong....


Around Midterm Exams , The people in my class started talking weird to me.They would talk about my relationship with my friend and How I've met him and stuff but they wouldnt ask anything about me , it was always about him.So i was really weirded out why nobody would explain to me about why are they talking to me like this.In the middle of all of this , I've found out the truth.It was a classmate that told me about it and We havent really talked up until during this time.lets call her 'A'.She was a very honest person , she didnt care about me being shy to talk to girls. I was shocked to see that someone else actually cared about me.(I didnt want to ask her out later because i feared that she would reject me).She told me about the situation regarding my friend.She said that everyone are keen on me and my friend because they are hearing the same rumours i heard the previous year but this time i was targetted because i was his friend.But i was confused as to why i wasn't last year like this.She told me its better if you stopped hanging out with me.At that point i was mentally conflicted about leaving the person that helped me with social anxiety (i was better at socialising now then before) and my only friend.I told her that not to judge him under the basis of these rumours and i dropped the conversation there.She also suggested that i shouldnt attract unwanted attention to myself but I was keen on finding out the truth of the matter.

Some days passed.
One day , it was at break time and my friend pulled out a iphone from his pocket out of nowhere and started showing off to others and the problem is that it was illegal for students to bring any devices with a camera to school. the worst part was that he started to take pictures of others and especially the girls.They were uncomfortable with it so i suggested to him that he should stop it and he didnt really care then.He proceeded to then show it off to people outside the classroom and at that time i knew that this was a recipe for disaster when i saw him do that.The break ended and we went back to our seats.The teacher came in and took class as normal.It was a bit noisy and out of nowhere i hear dead silence in the classroom.I look to my left where the door to the class is and i see our CT and another teacher together looking at me and my friend(who's beside me).I knew this was about the phone.CT calls him to come out of the classroom and calls other classmates too.He quickly tells me not to let a word out.The other teacher comes to me and she gave one of the scariest glares i've ever seen.She asks me about it and i said that i had no clue that there was such a thing with him and she laughs it off and says that she knows that me and him are buddies and she knows i saw it.At this point i knew that the person who snitched let them know about us and the fact that i saw the phone.I was cornered with no way out.I kept on saying that i didnt know.CT calls me to come out and i went.I tell her that i didnt saw anything.She told me to drop the act and calls me out and says that she's disappointed in me for doing this and believed that i wouldn't do this.She went on and said she doesnt need to hear me say anything and told me to go and tell my friend to bring the phone to her.I couldnt really come back from that.She said that she will let this matter go under the radar of the higher ups if we resolve this now.She offers to not bring any backlash if he just admits it.I decided ill talk to him and she called him out.I talked to him and let him know the situation and He still admits that he didn't bring it but now she asks where is it(My dude actually hid the phone somewhere before the class started).She looks at me and says ""i thought you said you knew"".At that point i knew i got played and i deserved it.I pointed out that i didnt know it was hidden.She says that doesnt matter.Me and the other classmates that were called spoke to him that its better to admit it and told him that she would let it slide.He agrees and tells her that he will personally bring it to her and to Keep her end of the word.The teacher was still pissed at me cuz i lied to her face knowing i saw the phone but she misunsderstood me knowing that i knew where it was hidden.So all's well and no one knows right? Wrong.The Events about to happen did it for me.


So the next day like normal ,  i go upto my friend and he proceeds to ignore me.I asked him whats wrong and he just replies angrily and tells me to f off.I knew that something was up.So A lets me know that there's a rumourgoing around that apparently i was the one who snitched on my friend and got him caught.I went upto my friend and told him that this is all false and told him the truth of what happened and he tells me that he tells me to f off again and to not see him again.He punches me in the face and i didnt fought back and let it go.Next day he starts talking trash about me behind my back.Everybody starts avoiding me now.The only one who really talked to me at that time was A.She told me that this was for the better and   it was about time that i stepped out of that relationship with him.It turns out that the rumour about him ctually smoking and stuff were real and The other guys he went out with to smoke actually confirmed this because they would talk to her and other girls about this because they thought that being addicted to smoking was some kind if talent that women would become wet for.They would ocassionally go out to drink and so on.I could trust this because it was told to me by A who trusted me to keep this truth a secret.Why would she let me know something fake and tell me to not let anyone know?.I kept my word and never ever talked to him ever again.It was like a weight was lifted from back but of course nothing ends well.He proceeds to be toxic to me whenever we get near each other and one day we got into a fight.I didnt pull any punches and let him have it.That was the first ever proper fight i got into and stupid enough it was with the guy who couldnt even talk for me when shit got rough.Fortunately the teachers werent called on.(I Understood later that the bully i slapped last year was actually one of his smoke buddies.He knew secrets about him that i didnt know about and that was why he didnt come to help me that time).I told him that ive had enough of this and we were done with this.I didnt talk to him after this.

The final exams were coming up.I was talking to A and she talked about how everyone avoids me even now because the rumours about my ex-friend has taken its toll on my status aswell.They all think im weird and proceeds to ignore me.What made me cry was there was a birthday party a while ago of one of our classmates and the only one invited was me.Everyone knew about the incident and they also believed that i snitched on him when it was just a lie to make me get hate.I hated everyone at that point and i was relieved to have A by my side.I eventually mustered up the courage to ask her out one day but before i could she says she can't talk to me anymore because the people now are targeting her because of me.At this moment i thought about ending it all there.I couldnt even think about not talking to her ever again so i hoped we could talk on the phone or chat but it didnt really work out.I eventually became the loner i was before.Everyone in the classroom became as toxic as the people last year.People from other class(they were with my ex-friend now)would ambush me outside the class and bully me.I didnt want to retaliate because i knew that would be bad for me so i seeked help from teachers but nobody really cared.They had the nerve to say that they will stop if you dont retaliate.Not even my parents belived me.They said it was because i was provoking them.I tried to reach out to other students but no surprise nobody wanted to help me.I eventually gave up trying and took the pain.Thinking back , it was really painful.It was more painful because it was for something i didnt even do.


So its march ,im 17 now and final exams were about to end but thats when mr covid came to say hi.That was when the financial problems came up again.Up until this point , me and my family could manage barely with the money we had but the virus just made it really worse.My mom was constantly in fights with my dad because he didnt want to get a job(ikr what a nice dad).It wasnt impossible to get a job here during the virus.


5 months passed , I finished the postponed exams.Results came in.I got '98% in 'grades(I worked hard damn it)I had nothing to do so i got a part time job at a new bakery that opened near us.The daily pay was really low but at the time i didnt have a choice.One day i came back from work and i see mom crying on the floor with blood coming from her lips.I rushed towards her and it seems she got into a fight with my dad.She said she has had enough(there were many other problems that led upto this but it all revolved around money).She said she wanted a divorce and it was all back and forth from that.My dad yells at me for not making enough to support our family.I was speechless.Look at his audacity to question me and my hard work when he doesnt want to get a job himself.I said to thank god that you were my father.(i legit wanted to punch him so hard).We eventually calmed down and i haven't really talked to him since.I was in disbelief that all of this was really happening so i called A(I actually called her and we talked after the finals result)  because i believed that there were no problems to her talking with me now.She didnt pick the phone.I tried to call again.Same result.I sent her a message and she didnt respond.Ive waited a couple of days.I eventually gave up.
She eventually replied she didnt notice.We talked for a bit and but she hanged up without responding to my call for help.Deep down i knew that she didnt want to talk.


A month ago,
I get a call from CT and she invited me to a get together of our class.I was happy to attend and i did.They all enjoyed the gathering , took photos , and so on.I didnt bother being a part of that.To be honest i actually went there so i could be alone and take my mind of things so it was actually a great opportunity to have some peace.I saw A there and went to talk to her.She avoids me again.I was growing bored of this cat&amp;mouse chase so i asked whats the problem with her and she tells me to back off.I decided that this wont go anywhere so i didnt take it any further so i left.



Present Day,
Nothing has changed really.Im still alone here knowing nothing about what to do with my life.Ive found this subreddit while scrolling around and i just wanted to know if what i did was right?.Thats all i wanted to know.Rather than that nobody talks to me now.Not even family.Ive been thinking about ending it now.I cant see a way to get out of this shitshow.",depression,What Am i Supposed To Do Here?,Early Life,LD EL1.csv
1.0,"hello. i have a problem that grew in me for years and became too much lately. 

(sorry for my english) (tw: suicide, rape, abuse)

im a very empathetic person and since i remember it makes my life a struggle. i was diagnosed with a depression, anxiety and bpd as a teenager (im 28 now) and through the years i like to say i got better cause i worked hard (im also on right meds). but there are things that also got worse for me. 

when i was an angsty teen i used to read and watch terrible stuff on the internet and i mean even the dark web level kind of stuff. why? i have no idea. it was unpleasant and i would say traumatic. in that time of my life i saw and read about the worse things that people are able to do to another being. when i realized how many vulnerable kids and animals are abused and raped daily something broke in me and its getting worse and worse. 

i remind myself about the dark reality all of sudden, more and more often, in the weirdest situations. i have visions in my head that are terrible and i cant ignore them. my heart is pounding, my throat is closing and tears coming to my eyes. and the realization that i cant help and save make my mind weaker and weaker. i was always suicidal but because of that i got worse again and started to think about suicide daily (and i was free from that for like three years). 

i have no idea how to deal with this. i tried to desensitize by educating myself more and more on the subject, take it as a simple reality that i need to accept, but it doesnt help. i like to call myself an activist, i do everything i can to make things in this world better but its always not enough so singing petitions and donating money dont help either. and im tired. cause no matter how hard i try to help its still a drop in an ocean.

any ideas how to deal with it? i appreciate your time and thank you.",depression,Cruelty towards animals and children make me wanna kms (trigger warnings),Early Life,LD EL1.csv
1.0,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the majority of my teenage years and early adulthood (21 now). I started to struggle when my life at home started to deteriorate. My dad, who likes to drink had started to become increasingly aggressive to me, he would blow up over anything, threaten to kick me out, or try to intimidate me or just yelling verbal abuse at me every chance he got. I felt very self conscious and truth be told, I started to believe everything he would say and it really took it’s toll on me. I began to withdraw myself from my friends at school as I had become extremely anxious. I missed more and more days of school as my attendance had always been great before instead choosing to stay at home and lock myself away in my room sleeping and watching YouTube so that I could avoid my dad and the world. Soon after this I sank further into depression as my gran died. This broke me completely and my mum, who has been the best mom I could ever ask for was shattered by the lose of her mum. At home it began to seem evident that as I would stay in my room for the majority, my dad had turned his anger to my mum...although never being violent towards her, he would try to make her feel like shit and put her down, then sometimes act like nothing ever happened. It was horrible to see that my mum who always defended me against him, was now becoming the recipient of his anger and I felt guilty for not doing anything but terrified of the consequences if I tried to intervene. My mum does everything for us, works full time and takes care of my grandad and is not argumentative in the slightest. I could see that the stress was taking its toll on her. Yet as her husband it seemed like he was only interested in pilling on more stress and making the house a very toxic and uneasy place to be. 
During this period I began to think that it would be easier to just not be here anymore as I couldn’t escape my all this stress, negativity, anxiety and had no motivation for anything. 

This went on for a few years until I eventually finished school and racked up the motivation and decided to get a job, and start trying seeing my friends again to combat my shitty home life although many had moved on with their lives, I was grateful that there were still a group that I felt wanted me around.
Things were starting to look up, despite life at home still being miserable.
Even though I had a job now, which I was able to keep myself together for, I would still feel anxious and stressed, sometimes over the littlest things. My grandads health has now started to deteriorate, and my mums health seems to be getting worse as well and she’s still having to put up with my dads shit. She had asked him for to leave but he refused and when she asked him for a divorce, he told her that she would have to sell the house, something my mum can’t afford to do.

I had also I plucked up the courage to ask out a girl I had liked for sometime. I fell for her way harder than I could of imagined and this only grew as we started to see more of each other which was difficult as the pandemic took over everything. 
Whenever we were together I loved it but I couldn’t help but feel anxious and stressed that she would call it quits after a while.
It eventually happened a couple months back and it has hit hard, just a few weeks before it I had been signed off my work due to anxiety and stress after breaking down in work and since then I have spiralled back into a deep depression which I can’t seem to shake and all I seem to have is negative thoughts, whether it be about worrying about my mum, grandad, the future, thinking about the girl I dated. It’s so overwhelming and I feel that I am such a burden on my friends who have their own stuff going on and I don’t want to constantly hassle them about how miserable I am and my mum who already has enough on her plate without having to deal with my problems and doesn’t need anymore stress. I have now fallen behind with my college course and yet I know it, I can’t seem to find the motivation to even get out of bed and do daily activities. The prospect of interacting with people is so daunting and makes me anxious, even with my friends.
I have never been so low and I can’t help but dwell on everything that has happened. I am now on anti-depressants which I was always reluctant to use, have been really struggling to sleep and having panic attacks when I get stressed.
Waking up each day just doesn’t seem worth it.
I feel so broken.

I’ve never really spoken about this to anyone so I’ve decided to just let it all out here since no one will know who I really am. It’s crazy to think that I’ve been struggling with depression since I was a kid. My cousins took advantage of me and my innocence. They molested me and threaten if I ever spoke up no one would believe me. One did things to me when I was only 5 another cousin when I was 8 and the last when I was 10. When I was 11 my grandma passed away from cancer and I could never cope with it and still can’t to this day. Then comes a different part of my life. I was going to start middle school/jr high with no friends bc I was bullied by my “friends” in elementary. At 14 I made friends with the wrong crowd and was taking ecstasy as a cry out for help. One time I had taken 5 pills and mix it with tequila ready to just end my life even tho I didn’t know that’s what I was doing. At the same time I began take those pills I was discovering my sexuality. I was at my rock bottom but I was able to pick myself up.

I tried so hard to make friends hs but for some reason everyone hated me. Maybe they knew about my drug addiction? Who knows. I was jumped my junior year and suspended from school for it. I met my first gf ever and I was happy for the first time in a long time or so I thought. She cheated on me and verbally and physically abused me. I tried to dead my life again but didn’t succeed. I graduated hs and my family was so proud of me but I saw myself as a failure. I tried to go to college and took a few classes but the fear of not being able to make friends and feeling alone scared me too much so I dropped out and disappointment my parents. 

I started working and thought everything was going well for me but then I started drinking every single night in my room by myself. I then started working in a theme park and made a few friends working there and even found someone I fell for. She was out and wanted to keep it a secret and which is exactly what my first gf did and I agreed to it but then it started again. I was being manipulated and abused by her. She made me believe she was the only one there for me and my friends weren’t my friends but when my grandfather passed away she was nowhere to be found and my friends were there for me. The relationship was very toxic and we decided we were better off as friends with benefits but even then she was horrible to me. One night she told me I made the relationship up in my head and what we had never happened. That’s when I knew it was time to ended everything. She made me feel like I was going crazy and I was drinking a lot more and tried to kill myself again but I couldn’t do it bc I thought about me causing my family so much pain.

Months later I download tinder and met someone and we just clicked. I fell so hard for her and then I drove out to see her almost 2hrs away from my place. I was so happy but I knew in order for it to work one of us had to move so I decided I would do it and so I did. I left everything behind and I was depressed again. All the friends I had made stopped talking to me I had no one at here and I was having a hard time getting a job. She was able to get me a job where she work but I wasn’t happy. I got a job somewhere else and I was so happy. I thought I would be able to make friends in this city but I was wrong. I was treated (still am) like an outsider. No one made me feel welcomed instead they all judged me for being a lesbian and made little comments and gossiped behind my back even went as far as started a group chat to talk about me. 

And now we’re here. Im all alone and can’t talk to anyone about my problems because I feel like no one will understand me. I live in a city where I barely know how to get around and don’t have any friends I can run to for advice or just to hang out with.

1.0,"It's my first time talking about my problems online and English isn't my native language so bear with my poor grammar.

I don't know what to do with my life, I spend most of my time doing shit I don't even remember I did because everything just feel the same, everything bores me, to the point that I don't know if I'm able to enjoy doing something anymore.

My life is what most people would consider a really good life, especially I my country, I live in Colombia and life for the majority of the people in my country can be really really though. But not for me, in fact, I was lucky to be born in a family that has enough resources for me to grow up with everything I needed and more. 

My problem starts in school, when I was little I was the typical nerdy fat guy that everyone made fun of so my social skills are not that good because of that, and I developed social anxiety and depressive tendencies. When I grew up and hit puberty suddenly I was what many girls would consider good looking so girls started talking to me, I started a few relationships out of need for love but I was used horribly and my social anxiety worsened, I started showing signs of depression, every morning getting out of my bed started being really really hard, everything started to bore me and nothing really felt nice or fun anymore, it was like the world started to lose color.

Fast forward a few years. When I got out of school I passed an exam to get to the best university of Colombia, I decided to become a doctor because a) I didn't know what to do with my life and b) I thought that if I helped people at least my life would be worth something. That gave me some kind of prupouse and I thought I would get better. But nothing got better, in fact it got worse, two years studying medicine just worsened my condition because of the stress, my family thought I was happy but I have never been worse, this year I didn't do shit, I wasn't able to enter classes because it felt so heavy,I didn't study, I didn't even do exams and now I lost my student capacity in that university, I felt so free, but my family is now constantly reminding me of that failure now.

Now I don't know what to do, I don't have any particular talent, I don't have anything that makes me happy, my life just feels like such a waste of everything and neverending boredom, my drive to do anything is non-existent, I lost all my friends because of my social anxiety, and I feel so lost and alone, I really don't know what to do.",depression,I don't know what to do,Early Life,LD EL1.csv

1.0,"A little context, I have ptsd. I was sexually abused, raped, beaten, sexually assaulted, and neglected for three years by my cousin who was a teenager at the time. I’m currently in a legal battle regarding it. I told people who I shouldn’t have, so literally everyone my high school knows, I’ve gotten into fights because I get bullied for it. 50 flashbacks a day, sleep paralysis every night, self hate, self doubt, depression, disgust, confusion, shame, everything. I’ve felt it and still do. I tried hanging myself about two months ago, failed, and tried slitting my own wrists, failed at that too but I was close hah. I’ve attempted to kill myself 5 times now. I was taken to the hospital and stayed there for a week or so. There are several rumors that I lied about my trauma and am pressing charges just for money. My court case is going awfully, my life is shit.


So yesterday... I remember one crucial thing. A camera. He filmed it. Guess what that means? Not only did my cousin use me like that while I was there, he filmed it so that memory would cement in his mind and he could get off on me again and again. “Oh I’m not babysitting Christian today? I’ll just pull up the tape from yesterday”... Knowing that there’s most likely pedophiles that have used *me* to get off makes me feel gross and I fucking hate myself.

There’s no fucking light at the end of the tunnel. The abuse started when I was fucking 8 man. And now my parents are pissed at me because every time I get asked a question on the stand I break down crying or get too confused and then it looks like I’m lying...

I want to be healthier, quit smoking, fuck I want to do some yoga right now but I can’t get up. It just feels like I’m not in control of my body anymore. I don’t want to burden my partner with my sadness, I don’t want to get triggered everytime I’m even reminded of my family. 
I’ve gone many miles away from my family and yet it feels like their words and actions echo in my head. Like I never left them at all. I hate them. I can’t get far enough from them, how dare they treat me like shit for 20 years and think that it’s ok. How dare they make me apologize to them for ‘causing stress on the family’ after I was honest and open about my depression.

He even exploited me sexually which is one of the darker chapters in my life that took me a total of 6 years to even talk about. And all they cared about was my grades. And since my grades were bad, well they just abused me more and more and more until I shut myself off and left. 
My therapist told me that sometimes people won’t change, and that distance would help. She taught me how to cope and how to fight these thoughts. I wish I had someone to talk to about this.

1.0,"Sometimes I just don't understand how I can be so unlucky and miserable with my life, it's ridiculous every time I think about it.

Since I live in Taiwan and my parents have been sending me to meaningless cram school to prepare for the entry exam for junior high school, I basically have all my time studying since I was like fking 10 years old. Now that I think about it, I have never had a close friend and let alone a girlfriend. And it all just because I spent all my time studying school bs and having completely no entertainment at all. 

And finally, after all my hard work studying fk 10 hrs a day for the entry exam, I got in the dream school (for my parents not for me). My classmates inside that school were all very mean. I was called 'piece of shit' every single day, and I dared not saying anything back, because I felt that would make them bully me even more. Also there were multiple classmates who would hit me or laugh at me whenever I did something they didn't agree with. 

And I suppose the main reason they bullied me was because of my fking miserable height 160cm (about 5'3) which is like the lowest 1% for Taiwanese male. I lacked confidence doing anything since then including talking to a girl. Before university, I have never hanged out with a girl even as a group.

After my miserable secondary school life, I was finally in university and got out of the control of my parents. And with massive luck and my own effort, I had several friends and a very close female friend(my girlfriend later on). All of a sudden, the fking Chinese virus showed up and ruined everything. I was forced to have a long distance relationship with her and things didn't work out. Therefore, I probably lose the only chance I will ever have such an intimate relationship with someone for a stupid pandemic.

Sum up the story, I have always had no friend since my parents forced me to study for something I am not interested in. Then in secondary school, I found out the fact that I have a pathetic height and I was bullied for whatever reason. Then after all that and my parents kept telling me I could have a happy life once I got into a great uni, and in reality I don't due to the fking virus ruining everything.

And now, I am extremely introverted, lack of confidence, lonely af and don't have any hope for my future.

1.0,"I want to preface this by apologizing for the length of the post. As an amateur writer, I’ve often struggled with writing out beginnings. I don’t mean to answer any big questions, or offer any kind of advice. I simply want to share my two insignificant cents on my experience with depression.
My earliest recollection of being aware that I was at an imbalance was in a ninth grade English class. I forget what the assignment was about but I remember being pulled aside by the teacher and telling me that whatever I wrote had alarmed her to the point of notifying a social worker. I thought it strange that I had to go through this, but in hindsight it helped explain a lot. After meeting with the social worker and being asked a few questions regarding the stability of my psyche, I was diagnosed depressed. This actually became news to me. I figured everyone felt the way I had at some point in their lives. In other words I guess everyone felt hopeless at times. But I guess my issues went a bit above that. And to top it off the social worker said my folks would be notified of what had just transpired. My initial thought was “Fuck.” It’s been unnerving having to speak with my parents about my mental health. So you can imagine my surprise to come home to find my intermediate family members sitting in a circle in the the living room. What followed was like an intervention-everyone telling me what I mean to them, the significance of living and existing. You get it. All I could think was how the social worker did me dirty. 
In the years that followed I’ve been on a roller coaster with my depression. Was able to mange it with physical activity. (I was in cross country/track all throughout high school and continue to run.) To having periods of simply drinking my days away. Being on antidepressants, being off antidepressants. Talking to various therapists to trying to handle things on my own. Meditating in order to find inner solace, to attempting suicide once.
For me depression is a good friend. I love them, but sometimes they overstay their welcome. I struggle with it everyday, Somedays are better than others. What gets me through is simply the drive to move forward despite the meaninglessness of it all. I’m a little bleep in a vast radar.

Prior to college I never experienced any of the usual milestones of teenagehood. I never went to a party, I didn't had friends to hang out and do stupid things with. I don't have any fun stories or wild memories because all I ever did was go to school, go back home, sit in front of a computer screen for hours daydreaming about living a normal life like all the other kids.

College wasn't that different, I remained living at home with my parents. I didn't do anything either, I just went to college and then back home to my computer.

I was dealing with depression since I was 14. I always knew something was wrong but I couldn't think of anything that serious. It became worse and worse but I was dealing with it in a way. I was distracted by many things (school, parents, friends etc etc.)

It instantly led to an eatind disorder after a year. Now I had a huge awful feeling that causes an ED and then the cycle goes on like that for 6 years and more. 

Then I went to uni in another country. I was living alone now. No parents nothing. I thought I was fine at first. The first 1 and a half month. I had some friends who I instantly talked about my past and sad lifestory.

It suddenly went downhill. My ED was at its worse and my depression became so intense that I was suicidal at that point. My friends were dead worried. They talked about how I need an ACTUAL therapist and naybe medication. I didnt listen for a while but then I realized that I was actually going to die and felt like shit. 

I was constantly sad and crying and depressed and I was dead worried that I was going to lose my only friends cause of this shitty stuff. 

Then I actually started my therapy and it was the hardesr thing ever. It took me months and medication to become better.

1.0,"A little bit of backstory 1st.

My father was a drug addict and my mom couldn't take care of me as she could barley afford to live on her own so I had to stay with my grandparents . my grandfather died when I was around 8 and I was there when he passsed away on the couch (he died from stomach cancer) he was like a father to me when my real father wasn't there. 

Fast forward a couple years in now in middle school. It was around this time when i met my best friend. She felt like the 1st real friend I ever had in my life i was always a introverted and very shy around people but for some reason I felt safe around her she was the 1st person I told i was suicidal. It was also around this time in middle school when i was sexually violated by 2 other students at 2 seperate times one male the other female. (It was also around this time my mother got custody of me) 


My friend meant the absolute world to me I loved her more then anything else. She was there for my 1st suicide attempt she was there when i 1st started cutting. And on return I would be there whenever she needed me whenever she went through a breakup I was there for her i would even carry her stuff for her when she needed it. I felt as tho she was the only reason I needed to live.

Then in high school everything changed she started pretending I didn't exist when she hung around certain people whenever i tried talking to her she would get pissed at me for seemingly no reason. 

After about 3 months of her acting like this I just went off yelling at her in the empty school hallway there was nothing more then that just yelling then after a short while I stormed off thinking out friendship was over.
The next year or so was nothing but pure hell. The next day she had told everyone that I had tried to rape her and that I had her by the throat against the lockers which wasn't true at all as I never even put my hands on her.


The entire next year was me getting harassed and beaten over shit i didnt even do. I would get confronted by her friends almost every single week one time they threw basket balls at my head the next I was being beaten against the bathroom stall. 


All of this also lead to a police investgation over her rape claims however the charges were dropped when she addmitted to lying. It also lead to my then girlfriend at the time breaking up with me as she believed her lies. The only people who believed me were the teachers who i was now staying after class with until the hallway cleared for fear of being confronted or beaten up by somone. All of this was made worse by the fact that all of this was being done to me by someone i loved more then anything else in the world. 

This all lead to me trying to overdose on sleeping pills come begining of the summer which obviously didn't work. It also lead to me getting PTSD now something as simple as hearing her name makes it hard for me to breathe. Ive encountered her a few times since then and every time has ended badly just seeing her leads to me having a panic attack. 


I tried talking to my mither about this to which she said she doesn't think to which she just said ""I don't think you should be upset or even mad at her shes just a girl"". 


Now I'm sitting here 2 years later lonely no friends no girlfriend my birthdays coming up and I made a deal with myself saying how if things didn't get better i was gonna buy a gun and shoot myself.

i've never really had a close friend, only people who are a bit more than aquaintances. i've never had someone to have sleepovers with are hang out with outside of school. until the 7th grade i met this girl, Ava. she was a good friend sometimes i hung out with her outside of school but not often, she wasn't really social. i wanted her to be my ideal best friend you see on tv. frequent sleepovers, hanging out often, talking on the phone etc. she didn't like to do that stuff. i'd find myself begging her to do it sometimes. fast forward just over 2 years she started to ignore me which isn't the first time. and a month of ignoring me later she says ""i don't think our relationship is healthy"" which is not all she said but that is the most important. we stopped being friends. so my one close friend i had for 2.5 years was out of my life for good. this was a month ago.

Thinking back over my childhood and past, I realized that there have been numerous lapses in time where I don't remember anything. With the majority being cases of being in class, and being yelled at for not paying attention, or not remembering what was just said. Then the wreck I had I blacked out, I was tired and my mother has been pressuring me into thinking I fell asleep. When the truth is I don't think I did, I remember the sensation as being not of sleep, but of stepping out of reality into a back void, then coming to and that's when I wrecked my car. It happened another time when I was working a different job, where I kept slipping in and out of consciousness. With at one point almost wrecking, yet I didn't given I fought against losing consciousness, and pulled over to gather myself. 

None of this is normal, yet it's all my fault and I'm causing it according to my mother. Which is really stressing me out, and making me feel like I want this to happen apparently. When I don't, it's scary and makes me feel like a ticking time bomb at times. I'm scheduled to see a neurologist, and I'm hoping to get some answers, yet I can't but help feel depressed and anxious over the situation. 

For all I know I am indeed crazy and I'm causing all of this somehow. On the other I'm not, and I have a serious neurological condition which could seriously impact my life. I just don't know what to do at this point, I just want to feel normal,yet I feel like a freak as put by my own family given I'm causing this on purpose.",depression,I feel like a freak,Early Life,LD EL1.csv

I don't even know where to start. Maybe even since I was born then. My mom and (her mother in law) my grandma have internal conflict. But it weird like my mom told me my grandma is traditional type whereas she hate to have granddaughter but doted on grandsons more. Thus, my mom send me to the baby sitters house.  My grandma perspective, she say my mom don't like my grandma and that why my mom didn't allow my grandma to take care of me.  (typical asian mother in lawdrama). My grandma told me I was sexually  molested and treated poorly.  This place, I guess I rememebr I was lock in the toilet whole day.

I'm 23 now I trying to forget all this but everytime they would force me to go my grandparent hosue to joke abt my trauma.  They always talk how wonderful they time when they take care of my brothers. Excluding me cuz I was babysitting hell. Of course I would feel like shit. 

In addition, I not allow to go out, talk to boys, constantly clean after my families. I remember there one time I befriended a boy. My mom beat the shit out of me and had me kneeling in front her bed the whole night. Even now I'm 23, I still cleaning after the family but now I crave for freedom like to jsut hangout with my friend and stuff. Or pursue my hobby or career.

After years of mental and verbal abuse. My issues treated like they weren’t a big deal emotionally neglected and ignored. Treated like shit threatened with violence. Suffering loss after loss. Why is it my responsibility to get help. How come I have to help myself. Especially coming from my parents who caused the issues I already suffered from clinical MMD and they added anxiety and panic disorder along with worsening my depression. And then after being mocked insulted and straight up threatened by my sperm donor(lost the title of dad long ago) my mom just let it happen(don’t blame her too much she’s non confrontational and timid) but I’m told the only way to get better is to help myself. Fuck that. Why should I have to work to do that when it’s others who made me like this why should I have to put financial stress on myself to pay for all of it. I’m living just long enough to spit on my sperm donors grave when he’s gone.

1.0,"Sorry if this is not the right sub but I have just been feeling a lot of guilt lately over past actions. I just need someone to talk some of these events out rationally. Whenever I start to feel happy or proud I will just remember these events and feel horrible about myself. I have not been diagnosed with depression or anything, but any time I am alone with my thoughts I will obsess over these mistakes. Here are my biggest regrets:

1. In middle school there was this autistic kid. I was in a friend group. Initially I started to talk to him in class a little bit, and he would sit at our lunch table. We would talk to him and stuff, but I think we might have been making fun of him. I think I thought we were just being his friends, but sometimes we would get him to do stuff that is inappropriate. For example, my friend made him call one of the teachers at our school a bitch. Initially, I laughed and went along with it. I don't remember specifically trying to get him to do anything, but I was definitely involved. After thinking about it, I realized this was bad and tried to get our group to stop making him do this stuff and just be friends with him. I talked to him about it once, to tell him to stop listening to my friend group, but I don't think he understands it. I think he likes the attention it gives him. After that, I genuinely tried to be friendly to him, I sat by him in a class, I gave him hi-fives in the hallway, etc. But I still feel bad about what happened. This may be my biggest regret.
2. In middle school I made fun of this person who was 'weird'. In cross country, me and a couple friends would make fun of him. One day I made fun of him for having a boner, and I saw him walk away looking sad. I felt really bad right after I said it. I went over and talked to him and tried to make him feel better. I don't remember exactly what happened but I remember he said he doesn't have a lot of friends and that he is sad. I tried to make him feel better and encourage him. I was nice to him ever since then, giving him words of encouragement. This year, in high school, I sat by him in class and am his partner. He still has low self-esteem and seems to doubt himself, but I try to give him words of encouragement. I still feel horrible about what I put him through, though. 
3. In middle school, I made fun of another person once in gym class. I made fun of him for 'copying' me and a friend (idk why). That is the only instance I can remember being mean to his face. Also, he would be a partner to my friend in class and I would try to get my friend to stop being friends with this person. This one wasn't the worst thing I have done to a person, but I feel bad for never apologizing or making it up to this person. I did kind of try in 8th grade, but I saw him drawing nazi symbols. I then thought I was justified for being mean to him since he is doing bad things, but I still don't think I am. 
4. In elementary school, I liked this girl who just came to our school. I don't remember what I did, I think I told people that she liked my friend or something, in any case I made her cry and she told the teacher. I was really mad at her for doing that at the time, and I talked bad about her behind her back. It was a weird situation though, because I still liked her. We became friends in 5th grade kind of. I think I did apologize to her right after, but I didn't mean it. I feel bad for making her cry.
5. In middle school one of my friends was dating a girl. Our friend group didn't like her, so we tried to get him to break up with her. I don't think we were ever mean to the girls face, we just didn't like her for some reason. In fact, I was always nice when I talked to her, but mean behind her back. My friend actually didn't break up with her for a while though, partially out of spite I think. Afterwards I did feel bad and was nicer to her. I still feel bad about the whole thing though. I don't think she knows what we did behind her back.
6. In middle school we tried to get this guy out of our friend group. We didn't like him for some reason. I wasn't mean to his face, but eventually he did leave. However, other people in my group were making fun of him I think and he started crying at lunch. I felt bad for him and talked to him while he was crying. I think I made him feel better, but I feel bad about trying to kick him from the group. He doesn't hang out with the group anymore.

Thank you for reading this whole thing. As you probably noticed, my 'friend group' was involved in a lot of these regrets. I no longer associate with this group, as I now know they are pretty mean to people. I stopped hanging out with them at the end of middle school, but the regret from that time still lasts. 

The guilt and regret I feel are tough. I can't focus on things sometimes, it is always at the back of my mind. I obsess over these a lot. I can't stand feeling like a bad person. I feel like all of my accomplishments are just going to waste since I don't deserve them and they are ruined by a permanent stain. 

If possible, can someone discuss with me at least some of these regrets? I think I would feel better if I could just talk these through with someone.",depression,Guilt and Regret,Early Life,LD EL1.csv
1.0,"It has been quite a few years of major sadness for me. some soul-crushing

My mentor that I have known for 15 years died in Aug 2013. He was the one I talked to because my father didn't talk to me. It was a hard blow. He was a friend, a father figure and a mentor. He talked to me about everything. He wrote me a letter before he died telling me good stuff about myself. He always stuck up for me. It was a real hard lose him.

my father died on Dec 7 2013. We were estranged for 10 years. we saw each other 2 weeks before he died. It was really hard because he wasn't the dad I had known all my life. He had a new wife that had two daughters that were married and had kids. I never wanted kids and I wasn't married so it was easy to let me go. He still talked to my sister and brother. The last advice he gave me was to do the best with what I have and don't focus on what I don't have like a relationship with him. The hardest part of this is that I was daddy's little girl. when I was old enough I went to work with him with his construction business. I worked for him for 10 years. we used to go out and do things all the time when he was married to my mother but when he got remarried he didn't want to do anything without his girlfriend which pissed me off because we used to always have daddy/ daughter day even in my 20's. I am 50 now and it still hurts because I saw his new wife's daughter at my father's grave and I got jealous that he picked them over me.

In August 2016 my other mentor from work died. We were real close and work together for 17 years in the same department. I caught to see him two days before he died. This is another really hard one for me. He was my friend. We made up plans that we would run the department and the two of us were unstoppable.

In Dec of 2016, my grandmother died. I used to visit her weekly and she would make me lunch. I had a really special connection with my grandmother. I was the only one to help her with bills and shopping. I would read her, her mail. I would do all of her paperwork for Medicaid and social security. I saw her more than her own children did. I found her unresponsive in her bed and we call the ambulance. When she went into a nursing house I would visit twice a week so she wouldn't be lonely.

In March 2018 my dog died. that was very hard to handle because I had to put him down after having him for 15 years.

In 2018 my uncle died.

In 2019 my aunt died. My mother and I would go over for company and play go fish. When she went to the nursing home we used to visit. I was close to this aunt growing up and I always wanted to be like her. She was my dad's only sister.

In April 2019 my cousin died of an OD. he was only 28 years old I tried to help him get help but he wouldn't listen. I would have him work for me for extra money. He was the kid I babysat when I was a kid. I posted his funeral on Facebook and my uncle got so mad at me he disowned me. He said he didn't want any of my cousins' druggie friends coming to the funeral. well, 5 people show up. they were friends of my cousin since childhood and one girl that he used to date. There were no druggies at the funeral. but my uncle didn't care and now doesn't speak to me. I lost my cousin as well as my uncle that day.

Spt 2019 my fiance of 10 years said he wants to move to Florida. We didn't live together because I worked in live around Boston and he lived in NH.  He didn't like his job anymore and I guess he wanted a change. We talked about getting a vacation home in Virginia but Florida never came up.  He told me in September he was moving to Florida and he was gone a month later. I broke up with him. I could do long distance from Mass to Florida that's ridiculous. I told him he ought to move in with me but he wanted the sun. Now he lives in a senior living community trailer park in the middle of Florida. Not even by the water. ( he's a big fisherman). He calls me to come down all the time. he wants to get back together and he wants me to move to Florida. A little about me. I own a house with my sister that will be paid off in 8.5 years. I live 2 blocks away from my mother. I have been working for the same company for over 22 years and I was planning on retiring with that company. I worked hard to get my seniority and I don't want to lose it. Plus I love my job and boss. Was I supposed to love him more and move my whole life for him? If I don't live in my house my sister couldn't afford it.

After we broke up after that first week his family unfriended me on Facebook and the kids didn't talk to me. I thought we had a good thing but I must have been wrong. I was always good to the kids and always put them first.

In Dec  2019 my sister and my niece got into a fight. My niece and her daughter lived with us. Well, the fight was so bad they left and never came back. I help raise my niece and that was the main reason for getting the house. So we could all be together. It was my sister's fault for the fight and now my niece wants nothing to do with us.

I feel like a lost all the good people that genuinely loved me and that I like and respected. I feel so lonely after losing this many people that I was close to. The holidays are hard. I just think of all the people I miss. 

I take my dog out for a walk and I am crying the whole time. I go down to the cemetery to see my family.

My life is a total mess, I've come to think I can't be fixed, Im totally worthless, all I do turns out wrong. I don't want to die nor do I wish to be dead, I just wish I could feel truly happy.

My parents don't help. My mom is very mean most of the times, 50% I'll say, the other 25% she feels like a true loving mother and the other 25% se feels like a school bully straight out of a Disney channel movie. 

My dad at the other side is too obsessed with me becoming a true man, so he took most of my childhood away preparing me to become a adult... Im now less than 2 weeks away from becoming 18, but I don't feel like I was allowed to be a child.

I was diagnosed with Asperger and ADHD when I was around 3 or 5. My mom hid this information from me and never went forward with proper medication. She had lots of arguments with my school's principal who wanted to get me into medication because I was struggling a lot, my mom refused and then proceed to tell how evil my principal was cauz she wanted to give me some scary pills. Of course me being 8 just believed what she said. Just now I realize my principal was trying to help.

Im turning 18 soon, I am scared of the idea of getting medication. I guess all of those ideas my mom implanted in my head are still there. I will go see a doctor as soon as I can after I turn 18.

Thing have gotten pretty bad since around 5 - 6 years ago. My grandpa died, and I kinda entered this state of grief I feel Im still stuck on. And just this year lost my great grandpa and one of my grandma's sisters. One died of old age, the other of cancer, few weeks apart. I feel I could have spent more time with all 3 of them, but now they are gone. 

I get little moments of happiness here and there, but they quickly fade away, and Im just left wanting more.

Around people Ive forced my self to put up a act. I look happy, genuinely happy, but I don't feel like so, my words and actions reflect how I truly feel. I haven't found a way to change that.


Recently I've began losing my self on videogames to keep me busy. I enjoy flighting games a lot and I also practice martial arts. I recently got into smash and Im very bad but I like to play with my friends whether I win or lose it kinda makes me feel happy to play with them, so I keep asking them 24/7 to play and I think Im starting to anoy them, I don't want that, I just want that warm feeling I get when I play with them.

1.0,"Putting this into the void.. I need to get some things off my chest.

I dont know what's wrong with me. I'm so fucking tired of being this person. My whole life I've felt off.. I can't remember a time I was really happy, at least for a prolonged period of time. I barely have any memory of my childhood/past. I remember some stories, only ones that I've been told or that I have told to others, but it doesn't feel like I lived them. I feel like I cause all the bad the bad things that happen around me. I don't know how to describe it but it feels like there is something gross and evil in me.. its taking everything from me and everyone around me. And I feel like everyone knows it and hates me for it.

When I was 15 my mom committed suicide. I will never forgive myself for my selfishness when she was sick. I blame myself. She did it while my dad was picking me up and we found her when we got home. I was buying ice cream when she was taking her last breath. The last conversation I had with her was a fight over something stupid of course, me being myself. My mom was amazing and nothing like me, except for the mental illness I guess. She was outgoing and loving and intelligent. I can't help but feel like I made her sick. Its hard for me to remember a lot about her because thinking of it is too painful so I try to avoid it.. its always playing in the back of my mind though.

I've tried... even when I was younger, like 10/11, I tried therapy but it didn't  help. I've been to a lot of therapists off and on since then but nothing has stuck. I started grief counselling this year but there's nothing that can be said that changes the things I'm feeling. I was on SSRIs for 4 years and finally gave up trying with them after being stuck in this cycle for so long. I'm on Wellbutrin now and some of the apathy from SSRIs is gone, but some days I'm too emotional to function. I'm talking hours and hours of sobbing and just overwhelming sadness. I do get out of bed most days now though. Also, it makes me inconsolably horny... I am pathetic!!!!

I'm 20 now. I'm in third year of university, I'm going through the motions but it feels empty. I do things I regret constantly. I have a problem with binge drinking until I black out completely and throw up everywhere. Usually someone else cleans it up because I pass out. I'm so tired of being this burden on everyone around me. Theres some sick part of me that loves feeling like this.. I put myself in bad situations that I know I'll regret, like having sex with a stranger that I'm not even attracted to. But something inside is telling me that this is what I deserve, and I believe it. I dont deserve to be happy. The problem is that I want to take care of others so badly and be needed by someone, but it feels like its always the other way around. I am grateful for the amazing people in my life who take care of me and put up with it but I feel like telling them to stop, since nothing they do will ever change who I am and they're wasting their energy. 

I think I'm losing it. I've been questioning my thoughts and memories and I don't trust myself or my brain anymore. I sleep excessively but feel like I'm never fully awake, just being dragged through life semi-consciously. I lose track of thoughts and words, I can't focus on anything, my mind wanders into nothingness all the time. 

Is it ever going to change? I've been waiting my whole life for something to shift, or magically click and everything makes sense and I can stop feeling like this but I'm losing hope.

My husband just thinks I'm lazy and finds my problems very annoying. I have had 3 major episodes in my life. The rest of the time it is there but bearable for the most part.

In my life I have not accomplished a single thing which I have strived for. I’ve wanted to be a musician my whole life and my 20tg birthday is only days away now. I have suffered from anxiety my entire life but it lessened when I picked up the guitar and started recording my own music. That was 5 years ago.

Since then it’s been meaningless sex with people I barely know and falling victim to becoming easily attached to everyone and anything, which makes me think I probably made a mistake and I’m never going to get her back. My career is going nowhere as I see people younger than me already being signed to record labels and making a living off of their music.

Even going on Instagram, I’m met with articles and articles about something in the news. It’s gotten as far as effecting my relationship with my family, because of this non-stop anxiety. They don’t know what to do. And neither do I, because on one hand, I want to know what’s happening in the world, but on the other my mental health gets worse if I listen to it.

even if I don’t feel anxious for a second I’m reminded of “that thing” that always looms over me and is waiting to destroy my life. everything reminds me of the reason im anxious and nothing makes the feeling go away.

feels like ever even trying to get better is pointless because the reason im anxious doesn’t feel irrational at all to me, like oh actually YOU SHOULD BE ANXIOUS, you deserve it and it makes sense because it IS GONNA HAPPEN. And if someone tries to console me I just think that I don’t deserve it and if they understood why I was worried they wouldn’t feel any sympathy for me.

1.0,"Hi everyone,

I have had this phobia of fainting from dehydration when I am outside. I usually carry a bottle of water wherever I go. Sometimes when I forget to take it, I get panicky and tend to want to buy a bottle of water immediately or go back home.

I want to know scientifically under what circumstances one can get dehydrated to point of feeling dizzy. I know it depends on a lot of things like how hot it is, what activity we are doing, body type. But I just want to know if anyone is aware of any medical articles which shed some light on it for a normal physically healthy person.

A large part of my exposure therapy is to reaffirm to myself that I drank water x minutes ago so I should be fine and any thoughts of panic are irrational. So I need to read some literature on this.

As an analogy, I used to feel afraid that I might faint due to an elevated heart rate, but science tells me that an elevated heart rate increases blood pressure and so it's unlikely one would faint (as fainting requires a sudden drop in heart rate). Knowing this helps me a lot during exposure therapy.

1.0,"I am out of words. I never thought i would overcome that stage of my life. I was suffering from depression and low self esteem since childhood and  due to lockdown and whole covid situation, i developed severe anxiety too. 

It starts with me waking up and I felt calm when I slept. Those depressing and hurtful thoughts were always in position waiting for me to wake up and hurt me. My heart used to beat hard, it used to pain. I had to lie down to make it slow down. It got so bad that sometimes thoughts of suicide seemed good. I always had this love for life. I knew life exists beyond my room but no job, many fears specially the fear of ""what others will think"" crippled me. But this love for life which was there deep inside my heart made me reject those suicidal thoughts. So, two and half months back, i finally decided to do something about it. 

I started doing meditation, cut down most of the social media except reddit, started focusing on why i  am having these thoughts? Meditation is the most powerful tool available to us and it changed me completely. It was really hard initially to just focus on your breath with all these thoughts attacking you continuously and i couldn't do it for more than 5 mins. But persistance was the game changer. Slowly,  my meditating time grew from 5 to 10 to 15 min and after a month, i was able to sit for 30 mins. I became mindful of my thoughts and my anxiety and depression started lowering. 

Thoughts can only harm if you let them. If you start ignoring them, their power on you start reducing and eventually they stop coming to you.  When you start focusing on yourself, the thoughts of "" what others will think"" don't matter much to you. 

Meditation helped me in ignoring bad thoughts and to explore what's deep in me, the Real me! I knew the power of crystals and bought an Om crystal necklace when i decided to change myself. I started wearing it daily and often do the meditation chanting  ""OM""( which is a really powerful word) and i believe my crystal necklace helped attracting positivity in me(maybe placebo, i don't know! But it helped) . My meditation sessions are so deep when i chant this word. 

Today, I woke up pretty happy. I am feeling this appreciation and gratitude for life. So, i decided to write this post if it can help anyone. My English is not that Good so pardon me for any mistake and for this long post too!

Lately, I've been feeling guilty everytime I spend money on myself.  I spend maybe 10% of my paycheck on myself each week, and am living fairly comfortably for a 20 year old.  I know I'm not in a hard place relatively, but looking for advice on guilt I feel with spending money on myself or doing anything that involves putting myself first.

I work 55 hours a week (12pm-11:30pm), so I logically know I should be able to reward myself on occasion, but I don't feel I ""deserve"" it.  Most people are excited to get things for themselves, but I sort of fall into a dark hole when I do.

There seems to be nothing ""right"" with severe anxiety.  If I don't treat myself, I get anxious about turning into a worker robot who lives to work and works to live.  If I treat myself, I feel like I'm undeserving and selfish.

I think a lot of it has to do with having a very fortunate childhood, and then I reached adulthood and starting mentally calculating the money my parents spent on me, and I feel like I need to pay them back somehow.

Because of my situation I wasn’t able to do stuff like go to my dream college, go to concerts and sporting events, and not even hang out with friends much. I will admit I used my pain and physical health as a way to push people out, I gave up on many things because I found no point in them. I allowed my issues to destroy me mentally a lot of time and I am fault for that.

I saw a post the other day and it stated something like “I have lived the same day over and over since march”, it was meant to be a joke about the lockdown. As I read this it hit me that my life was not affected at all by the lockdown. In fact the way I live now is the same I have for the past 4 years. I have friends who I talk to every once in a while, and family, but I don’t actually have someone super close that I hang out with, and I don’t have a social life. Worst part of my realization was that it showed me that I have no goals. I have not arrived to achieve, or even really accomplished anything in the last 4 years. Ever day has just been about surviving for the next one, and doing the bare minimum. All I have done is wake up, survive, and go to sleep. 

I let my physical health finish me mentally, and now I’m in a position where I don’t know how to get out. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I don’t know what my next step should be, and a part of me doesn’t even care about this things anymore.

1.0,"At my last doctors appt I finally grew the balls to actually tell my doctor that I’m depressed, this was about two months ago. I’m a minor, so I have to do the little mental health surveys and admittedly, I usually put down that I’m A-OK, while that isn’t the case. And although I did say on the analysis that I’m feeling depressed, I still lied about my suicidal thoughts and how little I take care of myself. And since I lied about it my doctor just told my mother that I’m “feeling a little depressed due to the pandemic and all that” Which is definitely the understatement of the year, but again, I’m to blame for that. Despite wanting to tell my friends and family about this, I still just can’t bring myself to do it. I’m definitely not telling my doctor anytime soon, I just get way too anxious and I don’t have it in me to have a panic attack at my doctors office. I do want help, which is why I’m typing this, but I don’t know how to bring myself to actually do it. Frankly, I’m pretty embarrassed about it, and my mom definitely can’t afford to pay for a therapist and any more medications than she already does. I don’t even know if my mom will take me seriously if I do end up telling her.

1.0,"I've always been an anxious person so I'm obviously overthinking this but my main concern is that everyone seems to be talking about being constantly exhausted and finding it hard to get out of bed and that just. Never happens to me? I have no problems with hygiene or keeping the house clean, I do procrastinate tasks that I find distressing until the last minute but I still get them done and I've always done that. I do feel unmotivated most of the time but I do fine at both work and school. 

I noticed that I don't really do things for fun anymore and my mood is obviously not good, it changes between sadness, nothing and ""meh"", my thoughts and perception of myself and the world are so distorted that even I can sometimes see how they make no sense and I do feel like I want to erase myself from existence because that'd be easier than putting in the work to get my shit together, I just don't do it because I know that'd be shitty for the people who know me. Like I know they care about me but I can't understand why when I'm actually worthless.

Can't judge my eating and sleeping patterns too well, I'd say they're fine but my friend says I'm just being dumb because my reasoning is that I sleep through more nights than the ones where I wake up at 2am or can't sleep at all...That happens but not often enough for me to consider it a problem.

In the last few days I can't concentrate and forget just about everything that happens during the day, I have a hard time recalling what I've done even when I know I've been really doing things. I find that part kind of scary. 

But my issue with all of this is that I don't think it's constant or been going on long enough for an actual diagnoses? I guess I'm scared that I go there and get told that there's nothing wrong with me and then I'll have to somehow just solve this on my own. I'm seeing a psychologist usually but we're on a holiday break for a few weeks and all of this has escalated only in recent days, so the last time we talked I didn't bring it up. I'm seeing her for autogenic training so the sessions have a pretty much fixed schedule and sometimes I think it helped already with my anxiety and in making an conscious effort to not isolate myself from my friends, but when I have to practice on my own it just falls apart and it feels like I got anxiety swapped for depression. I don't know how to put in the work to help myself and I guess that's the real problem here. I know I need therapy because even if I get out on meds or something my issues won't just magically go away but I don't think I can be proactive enough to go after the help I need, if that makes sense.

I'm 23 years (i know im very young but the thought of even another year is pretty unbearable) old currently going through a divorce from my wife of 4 years and a relationship of 5 years met in highschool and the relationship was awful, co-dependent, toxic, and suffocating. I have finally accepted that it was necessary to end after a couple months of debilitating depression and suicidal thoughts now, but I'm back to square 1. I have been depressed for about as long as i can remember maybe young teens ( i grew up religious so that wasn't really an option to be depressed). The biggest issue i face and have on a daily basis is i dont give a fuck about anything that actually requires effort. I have a couple friends that mean a lot to me and family that is supportive and love me but you cant just talk to loved ones about being depressed and how life is pointless 24/7. I go to college online because i was in the Navy and got out because that really drove my depression through the roof so school felt like the reasonable thing to do. Honestly though i wouldn't care if someone came and gave me the degree right now to do the job i am studying for because what is going to be different? ill have money? sure i guess maybe even meet someone new? yeah well then what. 

It all just seems like life is a fucking game where we can see who can convince themselves that what they are doing is important and i just cant. I cant convince myself that that's worth anything or distract myself long enough to get through this. I guess the only thing that keeps me going is a little sliver of hope that maybe one day ill find ""it"" or just stop thinking so fucking much and analyzing about what the purpose or meaning of everything is.

I think I have realized that my main motivation or deterrent from completely giving up or suicided is this weird idea of how much can I actually take before it will truly all just snap. So the longer i live the more opportunity for suffering and pain and it almost seems like that's my purpose is to just endure life for just the sake of enduring.

1.0,"Just a very long rambling from a waste of space.  I don’t talk to anyone about this stuff, so I figured I could just vent online. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

It’s currently winter break for me, but it’ll end in a few days. I’ve done absolutely nothing these past few weeks, but I didn’t think anything of it until now. I had a great time calling friends everyday, playing games with them, etc, and I was really happy. I genuinely was. The last time I felt like this was a month ago; it was so nice, not feeling like a worthless waste of space.

I have a brother who is a super genius. He has won multiple prestigious awards for mathematics and physics, has flawless grades without studying, writes research papers, develops apps, and has endless career opportunities. My friends all know him because he went to my high school; he’s essentially a legend. And yet here I am. A worthless piece of shit. 

My grades are terrible, my work ethic is non-existent, I have no passions, I can’t force myself to do anything, I suck at socializing, I’m butt ugly, I understand nothing at school, and I’m a failure compared to my brother—or anyone, really. I’m irresponsible and can’t do anything by myself. My dad kept nagging me to do SAT practice this entire break, and I didn’t touch the book once. The PSAT I took last year I got a 1320 while every one of my friends and classmates that I know got well above a 1500. This doesn’t even matter. Idk why Im talking about this.

In general, I just feel... worthless. I feel like I’m wasting other people’s time. I feel like my brother deserves a much better sister than me. He’s better off without me. I’m imagining how, in the future, he’ll be famous for some discovery or invention, and I’ll taint his name when news headlines say his sister is dying and homeless. He’s so kind to me, too. He answers questions when I’m confused (he knows literally everything) and he makes me laugh. I don’t deserve him. I should be dead. I shouldn’t be allowed to have him. He shouldn’t deserve to have a sister like me.

My friends, too. I don’t deserve them. One of them bought me a drawing tablet for me to use instead of my phone. What did I do to deserve it? Whenever I see it, I feel guilty that she didn’t give it to someone else. When I talk to my parents, I feel guilty that they had to have a child like me. 

And the ironic thing about all of this is that, I keep saying everything would be better without me, but here I am. I’m too scared to do anything. I tell myself to disappear, yet I want to keep living. I’m afraid of death, yet I want to embrace it. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I don’t know what to study in college, what career I want, what my type is for a partner, what my hobbies are—I’m just so lost. My friends all have a career in their mind and a list of colleges to apply to. I have nothing. I don’t even have a clue. I just want to disappear but keep living at the same time. I hate myself. I hate how I can even do the littlest things right. 

Im just waiting for someone to kill me since I can’t do it myself. I just have to keep living like this until someone can kindly end me. I want to enjoy life, but it’s really hard when you’re a piece of shit like me.

I don’t know why I’m writing a whole fucking essay on reddit. I’m just lost. I just want to rant. I don’t expect anyone to read this. I just want to tell someone or put it out there. No, i’m not going to talk to my parents about this. They’ll think I’m crazy. No, I’m not going to talk to my friends about this. They won’t care anyway.

But then. Everything went wrong and my depression came back. I started self harming again. I cried myself to sleep every other day. I intentionally hurt myself both mentally and physically.

I have friends I wouldn't give up for anything, and they both aren't mentally stable, and I'm really scared what one of them is going to do. He's been venting in a group chat, disappearing for weeks, and never coming back any better. He just wishes he could escape us, and this scares me, I don't think I can cope with anything, I can't really try to help, he won't let me, and even if I tried, I wouldn't do much good. My way of coping with things doesn't make sense to anyone, so I can never really say things clearly. I feel like I'm just burdening everyone. I want to kill myself, but honestly, I'd probably be more of a burden dead than alive. I was thinking about doing it today, but I just- wont. I'm so scared of 2021.

For some dumb reason I’ve saved the three hardest classes for last and I am taking a break winter quarter because this last fall quarter I thought about killing myself more seriously than I ever have before. I don’t think the break is necessarily wrong, but part of me thinks I’m just stalling. I’ve stacked the pressure on myself for this coming spring quarter.

The internship is stressing me out too. I don’t have anything lined up and I feel like I’m running out of time. Everywhere I’ve looked required a gpa of 3.0 or higher and my grades just aren’t there so I’ve never applied. I don’t have anything resembling an impressive accomplish to put on a resume or in a cover letter. I’ve worked part time at a car wash for the past two years and I have no experience in Cyber Security much less IT in general. 

I feel so fucking stupid, I don’t know anything that’s going on in my classes and my self care has tanked so bad this past year. I never really even wanted to go to college or study IT. I was pressured to go by my parents and I picked IT cause I spend most of my time playing video games or wasting time on my computer and I figured it seemed easy, but I really have no interest or idea at all about cyber security or IT or any of the complicated stuff. I didn’t really think it was gonna be hard at all, but I just have no drive to try. I want to quit and I want to die but I’m so close I feel like I’m letting down every single person in my life.

Later on I got anxious and told him I’m nervous and he warns me I need to have a good time tomorrow night if we go, but we can cancel if I want. I said no I’m ok.

Everyone who I say this to is so shocked, and will usually respond with, “don’t say that! I wouldn’t go that far?”

People around me are constantly encouraging me to have kids despite my stance and I tell them, “if I can’t find a good reason to be here, why should I be forcing someone else to try and find out?” At times I know it sounds dire, but really I’m a happy and goofy and optimistic person almost all the time, except when the show is over and reality turns the lights off for the night.

1.0,"""Dear Mom,

I do not expect you to understand the contents of this letter. After all, you didn’t really understand much at all in my life. I doubt you truly understood anything. 

Writing this letter, I wonder if you had not held me back in kindergarten, how would my life be different? 

I wished I had cousins that not only related to and had things in common, but were actually in similar life stages to me.

I wonder if I had my first kiss in high school or even kissed a girl at all. I wonder if I had gotten my drivers’ license at 17. Not trying to get one at the embarrassing age of 25. I wonder if I actually lost my virginity before I graduated from college like a normal person. I wonder if my life would have been allowed to be done so on time like everyone else. 

If I had worked hard enough in high school, got a scholarship to a top college would you have approved my wanting to be independent then? Did you realize that what I really wanted at the end was the “college experience”, which was in fact me saying I just wanted the adolescence I missed out on. 

If I had a normal college experience, I think I would have been more accepting of adulthood. The tedious 9 to 5 job. The inevitable cliched marriage. The stupid and petulant children. Your friends painfully disappearing at 30 because they are off getting married. I would have tolerated it. All of it. 

I wonder if my life wasn’t so sheltered and so coddled. 

Yes. With a heavy heart. I am sad I had to do what I did. The thing is though, I was 25 years old and so behind everyone in everything. 

You must understand. Finding friends is harder at 25. Sure, I could have maybe made friends. But being 25, 27, or 29, they weren’t gonna come out the woodwork as they would have at 17, 18, or 19. 

Plus, I wanted to make up for my lost adolescence. No 25 year old is interested in partying like in their college days. I also had doubts I would have been close to these adult friends. Friendships in your growth years like childhood, teenage years, and college years are important for a reason. Again, 25 is different than 19. They simply would have never been good enough to me.

In truth Mom, I hated being the favorite. I wish I was my older brother. Why did you love me so much? I knew you loved me, but it was so suffocating. Truth be told, all I wished was that you would go away. I absolutely hated that I was gonna be a late bloomer. 

In the end Mom, it wasn’t your fault. I should have known you were going to put up that big of an opposition. I should have as I said before, worked harder in high school and should have known college was going to be that expensive. I should have done much more to prove that I could have been independent. I should have put myself out there more. 

You must be asking why can’t you learn now? Yes. That is true. The social life I am looking for however, is not really possible at 25. Mom, the nature of relationships is just different at my biological age. You have to realize I am at an age that people begin to start getting married or have serious relationships. People have either less time or actually no time at all to have fun. Yes. I desperately want to be an adolescent again but that wasn’t going to happen. 

Mom. I need you to know. You have a son that has done everything right and on time. Stop your coddling of me and look at what has been in front of you this whole time. The perfect son has been there and for once in your life, acknowledge him. I must ask, why the fuck am I the favorite?

In the end, it doesn’t matter now. I am gone and hopefully at peace. Don’t feel bad for me. My life truly had nothing to show for it. Hopefully, the anguish is gone.

Have a peaceful rest of your life,

Your son""",mentalhealth,This is the note I am considering leaving my mother in six months. Been making long term plans for a while,Personality,LD PF1.csv

1.0,"I suffer from dissociative identity disorder, no one will probably see this and all this may be confusing but I needed to vent. Backstory: I started dating someone I really liked but it ended because my alter hooked up with his friend. 

When I look back at what I can remember from experiences from my alter I feel so shocked and scared. I can’t believe I did those things. I can’t believe I gave oral sex to a complete stranger. This was someone I knew nothing about but their name. I feel angry that this person used my alter and essentially me, my body. I feel disgusted that this person wanted sex in exchange for a drug. I can remember the taste of the cocaine in my throat as I write this. I can remember the feeling of the cocaine going up my nose as I write this. I can’t process that this was me, my body. I can’t process the events because this was something my alter did. I am just in shock and cannot even process it. I can’t think about the emotions during the moment because there were no emotions. I feel like any emotions felt would have made this easier to process but it just feels like a movie. Like I saw this all happen through a lens of movie screen. The only thing helping me ground myself in this experience is the physical feeling of doing the cocaine, which is really the only thing I felt. I remember standing outside of a hotel with him. He was looking for open hotels to go to. I was standing near him as he looked through his phone. I was not saying anything, instead looking around like some sort of virtual reality game. I am scared because I remember him looking up at me and aggressively asking me why I am so awkward. Then he asked me why I was backing up. What scares me is that I did not know I was backing up. My body was numb. I had no idea and still have no recollection of myself backing up. I could not respond. This time my alter was speechless. This was different from my first experience, or the first experience I can remember of my alter coming out. It was the fourth of July and I had arrived to a party at his house. At one point I remember looking around the room while the guy I was dating was talking to me. I can’t remember what he was talking about but I remember looking around the room and feeling a bit of fear because the surroundings and events reminded me of the first time I got alcohol poisoning. The room with a couch is what reminded me of that night. Sometime after that moment I felt a switch in my eyes and my alter took over. I feel shocked that someone could just lose complete control of their body, words, brain. I remember following his friend around. Somehow I followed him outside. I have no idea where the guy I was dating was throughout most of this ordeal. I can’t really remember what I was talking about but I know I was talking at the speed of light. I have little to no recollection of what my alter said but I know it was abnormal, strange, inappropriate. From the expressions I can remember he seemed to have a mix of confusion and shock. Apparently I kept asking him to give me a tour of his house, I would not stop. Then it became a tour of his room. I was aggressively coming onto him and wanted to have sex with him. Sex with a complete stranger. All I knew about him was that he did something in finance, used cocaine, smoked cigarettes, drank, and lived in this house. This is someone who I would not at all look at. I do not really have an attraction to men for their appearance. It takes me a while to develop an attraction as my attraction is all about personality. It has little to nothing to do with looks, which is the last thing I think about. I remember very little from that night but feel extreme embarrassment and shame from what I can remember. Aside from doing everything to try to have sex with this man I remember standing outside with him and the guy I was dating. The guy I was dating was trying to impress me. I remember being shocked that he did not have a robinhood account. To which he insisted he did, an obvious lie to try to save face and keep me impressed or something. Why would I shame someone for not having a robinhood account? That embarrasses me. The most embarrassing part of the night is something I can barely remember. I have never felt so much embarrassment in my life. His friend has kissed me in a room while the guy I was dating had left the room for whatever reason. I think the guy I was dating confronted me about the way I was coming onto his friend or flirting with him because I remember aggressively insisting that his friend would never do anything to upset him. That his friend did not try anything with me and refused to even give me a tour of his house. I insisted that my request for his friend to give me a tour of his house was innocent. An innocent request which my alter knew was not true. The entire conversation was a lie. I was very loud and reassuring about my lack of interest in his friend and his friend’s faithfulness to their friendship. I kept saying his friend would never and used the fact that his friend refused to even give me a tour of his house as some type of leverage. This part embarrasses me the most. Because he now knows those were all lies. This only makes my alter seem crazier, more manipulative, and deceitful. My desperate attempts to save face and my obvious and loud lies are what embarrass me the most. Us being so close against my car. The memory haunts me. I can’t stop feeling embarrassed. I replay that night in my mind consistently. I replay what I can remember, which is very little but beyond shocking, embarrassing, and terrifying. Its terrifying how I could lose complete control over my mind and body. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of the actions of my alter. My alter represents me. Now that I am back in my main personality I have to deal with the emotions that come with the actions of my alter. It’s like watching a video. I can’t remember executing any of those actions myself. It was like a movie screen. Like being a passenger in my own body. There is nothing I can do to redeem myself. It was all so extreme. These are things I would never do. I am so embarrassed and ashamed from my alter coming onto his friend- something she did so strongly. But what embarrasses me the most is denying those very blatant and strong attempts to sleep with his friend. Reassuring him so strongly that his friend would never accept such a request and was such a faithful friend for not even accepting to give me a tour of his house. I am so angry at my alter. I am beyond furious with my alter. Furious for representing me in such a way, furious for the embarrassment and shame she brought me. Furious about the impact she had on my life. I really liked this guy. There is nothing I can do to save myself from what my alter did. I am not angry at myself for losing control of my body because it was beyond out of my control. It was like being possessed. Possessed by a demonic jezebel. The best way I can describe this is truly as a possession. You can’t be angry at yourself for getting possessed because it’s out of your control but you can be angry, embarrassed, and ashamed by the actions and words emitted from your body from the possession. I am trying so hard to be nice to myself but I can’t get over that night or the subsequent events. I can’t get over the way the guy I was dating called me the most deranged and psychotic person he has ever met because its true. I never knew the impact my childhood would have on me. But why now? Why did it have to be when I found someone I really liked? Why did she have to embarrass me so strongly? Why is she so hypersexual, deceitful, aggressive, manipulative, and sadistic? Understanding, compassion, and awareness will not serve me. It will not reverse my actions, my representation. I have to accept what my alter did and how she represented me. I have to accept that these people think I am my alter. That my alter is my main and only personality. I have a strong hatred for my alter. We went through the exact same events. Why is she like this and why did she have to come out now? Why did she have to come out with those people? With the guy I was dating? Why years later? I keep trying to tell myself that I went through a lot but I don’t see it that way and have never seen it that way. I have always swept those events and occurrences under the rug. I never allowed them to affect my behavior or demeanor, especially around others. I am so careful with my actions, words, and behavior around others. Too careful. I never want to say the “wrong’ thing. My biggest fear is to upset someone. I can’t accept that I went through a lot because people go through worse and don’t turn out this way. I should be able to accept it and leave it in the past. I should be able to be mentally healthy at all times. I should be in control of my brain. How could something so much like a possession happen in my own body? How does one lose so much control in one second? I try to tell myself I went through a lot but still can’t. It wasn’t until I got to college and spent a prolonged amount of time with others my age that I first realized that I was different. Very different. I was not able to socialize in the way others did. I was not able to function with the ease that others could. I was not able to control my substance use. I became so addicted. This was not the case for anyone else. Nobody else had used so many substances. No one else was addicted. I had to do so much more than others to get through a single day. I tried to kill myself with drugs and alcohol. I tried to kill the memories. I tried to kill all of my memories from birth. Being molested by around 10 people from the age of 4 or 5. The beatings. What affected me the most was the sexual abuse. I wanted to forget it all or die trying. I wanted those memories gone because if they were gone I could move on with my life and life a happy healthy life. I could not accept the memories. I am so detached from the memories. They happened, I can remember. But I can’t process that it was me. It was me. This happened to me. I can’t accept this. That wasn’t me, it couldn’t happen to me. I have been thinking more about the memories although I still haven’t been able to process them or accept them. But I am trying to connect the dots between those events and my alter. I need an explanation for my alter. But the explanation is not an excuse. I am so angry with my alter. I try to tell myself that I was groomed. I was not only forced to engage in sex acts but was forced to act as if I wanted it. I was trained to instigate these sexual situations and participate in ways that were not physical. I was taught to role play, to come onto others, to behave in a manner that was hypersexual. To act like I wanted it, to act like an adult in a porn movie. I was probably around 7 when this particular girl started to implement sex acts into games. It started as a friendship, she was mean but I hung out with her. I was lonely. She progressively would try to implement these sexual games into our hang outs. I was reluctant for such a long time. I refused. Somewhere along the way she started to teach me these sex acts. Then would try to teach me and convince me to act like adults do in porn movies. The funny thing is I have never watched a porn movie but can tell from the media that this is the way porn stars act in movies. They act as nurses, doctors, and play out sexual situations in settings where this is not appropriate. She made me act like we were in a relationship, she made me role play. She trained me to want to engage in the sex acts and “act”  out different roles. She made me give her oral sex, she would put her fingers up my behind. I couldn’t have been more than 8 years old. This was only one of the few people that molested me. The molestations lasted years. Each person molesting me for a different amount of instances. I can’t remember all the instances, they were too many to remember. But I can remember the different people. This girl in particular had an affect on me. Other molestations consisted of sex acts that were forced upon me. She did this too but it was beyond sex acts, I had to participate in role playing along with these sex acts. I felt so much fear during all of these acts. All of the molestations gave me fear. I was molested many times by many people after this girl moved but this girl was the one who trained or taught me to act in a hypersexual manner. To engage in sex acts and “act” like I wanted it. This is a lot like my alter. She acts on the teachings of this girl. But why now? Why at 22 years old? This happened years ago.. I just don’t understand. I could never wonder if this was normal, if this was something that happened to other kids. I was always on fight or flight mode in a sense. I had to fend for myself, I could not focus on other kids. I try to tell myself that adults were not there for me. That I need to be easier on myself because I had to fend for myself. That dissociation was the only way I could cope with these events. The molestations, the beatings, the humiliation. But I am angry at myself for dissociating. I still don’t know what else I could have done as a child to cope with these events but I wish it wasn’t dissociation. Even now, I am not sure how I would cope if this all happened to me now. But a woman in a video I watched, who I think was a therapist or psychologist said it is an immature way to cope. I felt angry. I was not immature. I was a very mature child. I did the best I could to save myself. To cope with the emotions from the horror of my childhood. It was horror. I cannot accept that this happens to other children because seeing it from a second hand perspective will make me feel things that I tried to avoid for myself. I cannot process the idea of this happening to another child. I have trouble telling the ages of children. I think in a way it helps me protect myself from realizing how small I was when all these events took place. I once thought a 10 year old was 5. I still can’t accept she was not 5. I could not have been so small and young when this all began. No way. I must have been taller, weighed more, looked more mature. Im not even angry towards the people who did this to me. I feel nothing towards the people who did this to me. But I am angry at myself for how I coped with it. I am angry because of how it affects me now and how it has affected me. That was not me. That was my alter but I have to take the fault. I have to accept the consequences because it was my body. I can’t explain what it is like to have two personalities or how out of control I am. I keep telling myself that if I even had a bit of control over my alter then I wouldn’t have done the things that I did. But I don’t have control over the alter and still don’t. I am not angry at myself for the alter because it really is like getting possessed. That’s out of my control but I am so angry with my alter. I try to tell myself that there was no “mature” way I could cope with the events. I could not reach out to an adult. The adults knew. The adults were in on it. The adults were complacent. Some enjoyed watching while others were too uncomfortable to say anything. They did not want to feel uncomfortable by acknowledging the molestations or bringing them up so they preferred not to say anything. They did not just ignore that I was being molested but they chose to allow it to continue because it would be too uncomfortable for them to confront it. I was a child. You do not even have a full understanding of what is happening but you experience all the feelings that come with it. You experience the fear that persists through all the molestations, no matter how many times you have been molested the fear never goes away. You experience the feeling of being uncared for. I felt worthless as a child because I was never worth defending. I felt like this was normal, like maybe being complacent or too uncomfortable to confront the molestations was perhaps normal and even acceptable. I was truly on my own throughout all of the molestations. I cannot accept that. I cannot accept that I coped through dissociation. If only I had coped another way I would not have an alter. If only. I already went through so much and just wanted to forget about it. I can sweep it under the rug and focus on other things as much I want but my alter was a manifestation of everything I had swept under the rug. My alter is the only consequence I can’t kick to the curb because I am not in control of my alter. I cannot control when the alter takes over or what the alter does, like a possession. It truly was like a possession and for a while I thought maybe I had been possessed. I can throw out the drugs, I can pretend I never used drugs, i can ignore the addiction, I can leave the drug use in the past because it is not something that people can know about if they did not see me use. I can hide the alcoholism because it is not something people would know about if I did not tell them. I cant hide my alter, I have no control over my alter. My alter affects me and others around me. My alter has hurt people. My alter has hurt my image, my alter has hurt me. My alter has hurt me so much.",mentalhealth,I hate my alter,Personality,LD PF1.csv

I’ve dealt with it for my whole life pretty much. Except right now I’m experiencing an entirely new symptom in the form of auditory hallucinations. I’m literally laying in bed with my girlfriend and my dog and I swear that I hear someone talking outside. Very muffled and it sounds like it’s coming from a walkie talkie or something. Like I’m picking up a radio frequency. So I get up to look and there’s no one outside. I wait about 5 more min listening to this voice and I decide to wake up my girlfriend and ask her if she hears anything and she says no. I’m literally hearing it outside and she’s saying it’s completely silent. My dog is also not reacting and he’s a guard dog so as soon as he hears talking outside he’s at attention and even growling. So I don’t know what to make of this. I was even just today talking to my therapist about the thought of me going on anti psychotics. This is very upsetting, unsettling, and kind of embarrassing.

so im a 16yo girl and i have this problem where i feel like important people in my life are watching me from inside my mind. for example, today i felt that my aunt (who im pretty close with) was able to see inside my mind and through my eyes. she could see everything i was doing and could relay this information to anyone she wanted. it switches between different people (ie my parents, friends, crushes, family members, one time even my dead grandmother).

it's not necessarily a huge problem, but it kind of affects the way i act and behave. when my crush was watching me, i happened to be showering. i didn't want them to see me without clothes so i closed my eyes for almost 10 minutes and nearly broke my foot trying to walk back to my room to change. even when im not necessarily doing anything that i wouldn't want people to see, i try to act in a way that makes the person in my head approve. when it's my mom, i never cuss and am really careful about what i let myself see. when it was my dead grandmother, i got extremely upset (i loved my grandma very much) and spent two hours writing down things i would tell her if she were alive. i hoped that she could look through my eyes and see what i was writing.

the people can't see all of my memories/thoughts, but if i see something, they can access any thoughts or feelings about it. thats why im not getting anywhere on google. it's weirdly specific. for example, my aunt saw a sweater that was on my bed and immediately knew that i love it because someone i love gave it to me. thats the worst part about this probably. people seeing what i see sucks, but people knowing about my personal thoughts just freaks me the fuck out.

i know that it's completely ridiculous and that there's nobody inside my head. but i cant stop myself from feeling like there is. at this point, it's pissing me off and i want it to stop so that i can be my normal self. if anyone knows whats fucking with my head or how to stop it, i would really appreciate if you could tell me. i'm not able to talk to a school counselor bc of the pandemic and i doubt i would be able to get therapy/get my parents to help me. thats all.",mentalhealth,i feel like there are people i know inside my mind,Personality,LD PF1.csv

1.0,"I can honestly say that the world would be a better place without me. I’m a creepy, bizarrely mannered man and my social skills are terrible because I never got the chance to actually learn them.

I’m that one guy you know and wish that you didn’t. I promise you I’m him. I’m a shitty, childish edgelord with a crippled ego, I constantly try to look smart when I talk, I have no friends, only people who call me their friend because they feel bad for me. People constantly patronize me because I look legitimately mentally challenged - I have weird mannerisms, wear weird clothes, constantly stutter when I talk and genuinely don’t know how to properly interact with people... I only know how to feel regret and humiliation when it inevitably doesn’t go well.

And every single day I try so fucking hard to fix it but I’m too utterly incapable of understanding how to basically function that the entire effort inevitably goes to waste. It takes the strength of my entire will power every second I am alive to not give up on myself and I’m not even “brave” or “strong” for pushing through it like people try to bullshit me about all the time because I have no fucking choice but to live my shithole life and make an utter ass out of myself whenever I’m unfortunate enough to end up in anyone’s presence and I’m not about to pull the ultimate dick move by making people pay for an expensive fucking funeral and stand around for like 3 hours pretending like I had any actual positive impact on their lives.

I’m seeing a therapist, but she’s constantly telling me all of this bullshit about how nothing’s wrong with me. I sit and talk once a week hearing all of this utter shit about how much potential I have and how great I am; only to walk out into the real world and have reality prove to me the exact opposite as I humiliatingly fail at everything I do and increasingly lose my will to live. It’s not helping at all. Whenever I get a therapist, they never know how to respond to me. In fact, it’ll be a miracle if anyone responds to this god damn post and doesn’t do what would be normal - which would be accurately pinpointing me as a hopeless nuisance and moving on to do better things with their time than acknowledge me. 

I hate how I talk. No matter what I do, I end up sounding either weird, insulting, childish, or arrogant. I can get by when I keep my mouth shut, but if I try to speed the social skills train along just a little bit by talking more, people seem to get annoyed with and infuriated at every single thing I say.

I’m honestly a mistake of a human being and I can safely say that if you met me, you’d agree. I mean I had a shit childhood and was abused in ways so weird you wouldn’t even know how to process it if I told you... but god damn it.

I’m trying so... fucking hard to make things work 24/7 but they are still utter shit. I’m having a breakdown right now as I write this because I don’t have any alcohol in my house to numb myself with.

And before you tell me to pull my head out of my own ass... I am trying to as hard as I can every fucking day. I am well aware of the fact that I am a delusional idiot who deserves every self-inflicted ounce of misfortune he receives so I swear to god if you have any advice about how could slap the honest to fuck daylight into myself and not be an utter shitstain on the face of the earth for approximately 5 seconds that would make me deliriously happy.

I thought about joining the military so that I could get taught what actual fucking pain is and not sit around being a privileged, whiny, self-loathing sack of shit all day, but decided not to because honestly, you need functional people in the military, not fucking batshit insane shut-ins on some kind of circular quest for self-improvement. It would be insulting to the military for me to join simply because I think I’m a dirtbag and it would change me.

Am I just hopeless? If I am then honestly that’s fine. I can swallow that if I have to and already have to a degree by promising myself I’ll never get married, have god forbid have kids, risk subjecting them to the same pain that I went through growing up out by holding the same delusional belief that my parents probably had, thinking they could be better than theirs. 

But actually thinking about all of that is fucking futile too because people aren’t stupid. They know I’m a goddamn mess so they leave me the fuck alone. That’s what I was complaining about in the first place... even though once again, I completely deserve it.

Anyway, if you read that I’m so fucking sorry. No one will probably even see this garbage fucking post and I’m used to it at this point and just utterly ready to embrace the fact that I’m a complete piece of shit and continue to avoid the entirety of humanity for the remainder of my life for honestly both my own good and its good.

1.0,"The title sounds cryptic, I know, but please bear with me. This is a problem I deal with everyday, but I found myself mulling over it especially hard tonight, and I desperately need outside advice. For those who don't know, ARFID is short for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. To directly quote [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/) ""ARFID is similar to anorexia in that both disorders involve limitations in the amount and/or types of food consumed, but unlike anorexia, ARFID does not involve any distress about body shape or size, or fears of fatness. A person with ARFID does not consume enough calories to grow and develop properly and, in adults, to maintain basic body function.""

I know picky eating is a thing, but this isn't just pickiness. It just can't be. I've scoured the internet, and ARFID is the closest thing I can find to describe my problems with food. I'm 23 and my palette is limited to about 10 things, none of which can be considered healthy. (Fries, Pizza, and Mac and Cheese, just to name a few.)  I eat one fruit, no vegetables, and a couple nuts (peanuts and almonds).  Every time I'm introduced to a new food, I just smell it and stare at it. If I'm brave enough, I'll try it, but it usually never goes over well. The texture will hit my tongue and feel disgusting, or it'll taste awful, and I'll immediately gag and spit it out. If I can't spit it out, I'll become nauseous and puke. It's been this way for as long as I could remember with nearly everything new I've tried. Everyone in my life has tried to get me to expand my palette, but never in a good way. The many things that they tried were: I would be forced to sit at the table for hours into the night until my plate was clean (which would never happen), someone would give me something new under the ""just try one bite"" pretense and stare me down as I tried it; while they watched my every move and facial expression, or they would just force it into my mouth and become enraged when I spit it out.  There was even a time where my stepdad made me drink this disgusting green Bolthouse juice that had a bunch of different fruits and vegetables in it. It was a miracle I even got that down my throat because it was so disgusting, the taste alone nearly made me puke. I had to hold my nose and drink it like medicine. These kind of things happened all the time in my childhood, but the worst was when my sperm donor (dad) got really irate one night, grabbed my plate, and threw it across the kitchen, where it then hit the sink and shattered into tiny pieces. He then got in my face and screamed so loud he left my ears ringing. It's been years since then, but I can still remember it as though it just happened yesterday. So yeah, people didn't take my eating habits well. Even to this day they still don't. My family pokes fun at me constantly about how ""I'm so picky I'll only eat 10 things"", my mom constantly tells people how she's worried for my health, and my friends/roommates constantly try to get me to try new stuff, but they gather around me and stare at me when I go to try it. Then they get aggravated when I don't like it. And the worst part? I have Lupus. The nutrients my body needs, I'm not getting. Doctors have told me that if something doesn't change, and soon, I won't have a long life. But I just don't know how to change. I want to be healthier, but every time I think about eating something new I immediately become nauseous and on the verge of tears. I'll get so anxious that I have actual panic attacks, which then send me into Lupus Flares (which make me feel even worse). The subject of food has brought me to tears on numerous occasions. Even now, as I sit here and write this, I feel like I'm going to start crying at any minute, and I can feel my heart beating against my chest.

I hate living like this. I feel like I'm constantly being pressured, being stared at, and being judged. I hate going to any kind of parties or social gatherings because I'll only eat maybe one or two things there, and then when I don't eat I get asked why I'm not eating, and then my friends or family will answer with something like ""Oh she only eats like five things"" Or ""She doesn't like anything you have."", which then causes the host to ask me all kinds of questions that I hate answering. It's gotten to the point where I never go anywhere anymore, and when I do I'll only drink water or soda, no matter how hungry I am. I've even gone entire days without eating because I just don't want people to ask me questions. And when they do, I'll lie and say that my stomach is upset and I just don't feel like eating, which usually gets them to leave me alone. I'll even stay up late into the night just so I can eat when no body is around. Planning meals is a nightmare for me, because in my house, we plan meals that everyone likes so that everyone gets a say. But you know who's severely limited? Me! I tell them to plan around me and I can practically see the annoyance in their faces. I have a lot of problems, mental and physical, but my food hang ups are the biggest problem in my life. If I could just snap my fingers and eat like a normal person I would. If I had one wish, I wouldn't wish to be rich or powerful or anything like that, I would just wish to have the palette of a normal f\*\*king human being. This problem is the source of much of my self-loathing and anguish, and it seems like nothing I do can change it. I know that my doctor's are right, and if I don't change my eating habits I will die, especially given the severity and complications of my Lupus. But even being faced with a literal life or death choice isn't enough to help me. I want to change, I really, truly do. I don't want to die.

1.0,"I think I'm at the lowest point I've ever been in. All my healthy coping mechanisms don't work anymore. I've resorted to hitting myself in the head when I'm angry and ripping pieces of my hair out. I lash out at the smallest things, then go into a days long depression slump. It's for the stupidest reasons too. Everyone got their takeout food except for me a day ago, and I had to eat leftovers while everyone else got to eat their meals. I'm still crying about it and hitting my head. I know logically it's not that big of a deal, but God it feels like the end of the world. 

I've lost every little bit of motivation I had. Even the stuff that used to make me happy doesn't anymore. I used to love to read and write. I've tried to force myself to do these things again, and it just ends with me, again, crying, ripping my hair, and hitting my head. Nothing makes me happy anymore, and it feels like such a chore to do anything.

My only two friends are getting tired of me. One of them I've fallen for, but he's in a relationship. Only sees me as a friend unless it's for sex. I know the friendships toxic, but I absolutely adore him and he's one of the few support systems I have. I don't think I could mentally handle leaving him. 

I hate my therapist. Always asking the same questions every session, not making any progress, forget key details about me. I understand that she has a lot of patients, but it would be nice if we didn't always spend the same amount of time discussing shit we've already been over. She wants me to go to outpatient group therapy. There is no way in hell I'm going. I feel repulsed at the idea of sharing my issues with a bunch of strangers. I'm happy that it helps other people, but I can't do something like that. I don't even like doing it with my therapist, but I'm forced to see her.

I was gonna vent about the emotional Christmas I had but idk where to start with that tbh. 

But like I've had some weird mood swings where in the morning I'm chill but later I'm just empty and sad and literally really do just want to die. Like I've just had the most surreal most vivid desires lately to just stop existing. To just go to the bath and end it. I won't, but man I'm just tired of everything. I feel so empty all the time. I can't remember shit. I can't look back on happy memories because I just can't remember at will. I don't know who tf I am as a person. I'm just an empty blob. What do I like? What do I want? What do I want to do? I feel nothing towards it all. 

It's fucking scary and I hate it. I don't want to feel this way. I don't wanna be this way. I don't wanna be how I am. I just want normalcy. I want to feel normal.

And then I feel bad for my girlfriend because she has to deal with me and my shit. She does so much for me and I try to do as much as I can but I never feelnlike it's enough.

Nothing I do is ever enough to me. Nothing. I never do it right. I never do what I should have done. I could've done more and since I didn't it's soley my fault if things end up different than I wanted. 

I feel all over the place. Disorganized. Then I try and organize my life and I don't stick to my organization and it all goes to shit. 

I want to study but I avoid doing it. I want to work on my coding side projects but I just avoid it all because I don't want to ruin everything or I just can't get the motivation to. So I'll scroll through YouTube the entire time thinking ""I should be doing something else"" and sometimes I will but most of the time I won't.

I hate how I am and I should probably go to a therapist but I can't seem to make the call. I did go awhile back (like 4 years). They did diagnose me with clinical depression and general anxiety and put me on Lexapro which I feel helped but I got too anxious to to see the doctor again once my prescription ran out because I figured they think I was faking everything or something and judge me so I just never got a refill and quit everything cold turkey.

1.0,"Throwaway account here. This may be a long post, so I'm sorry in advance... I'd be especially interested if there are any therapists here with thoughts. 

I have had what I would consider mild mental health issues since I was a teenager, but nothing that was too unmanageable. Some bouts of insomnia here, a bit of social anxiety there, but nothing too unusual Then, around the age 24, my issues became much more punctuated. I started having panic attacks that became increasingly frequent and more severe over the next couple years. I also started having suicidal thoughts that became increasingly concrete. 

I could tell something was wrong, but I *really* did not want to go to therapy for a few reasons. First of all, I felt my issues were unjustified. Honestly nothing terrible was going on in my life. I have no real trauma, I am financially stable, I'm in a loving relationship, and the only major life changes that were happening were a couple of moves that went smoothly all things considered. Since there was nothing wrong in my life, I felt ridiculous seeking out therapy. Second, I do have a family history of bipolar disorder, and I know that my mom did not react well to the medications she was on. I was scared I would be immediately prescribed something that would have a negative impact, and although my fear was probably overblown, it definitely prevented me from seeking help for a while. Third, therapy is expensive. I'm financially stable, but I'm not made of money, ya know? 

Anyway, my partner recognized that something was seriously wrong, and what finally compelled me to go to therapy was the realization that my panic attacks were impacting his life as well. He was basically playing the role of therapist, and that was unfair to him. So I started going to therapy back in June. It has all been over Zoom because of COVID. 

I've been seeing the therapist every 2-3 weeks for an hour each time. She usually asks me what's going on, and I tell her about my mundane life. I tell her about my happy relationship, my decently enjoyable job, my close friends, and about how despite all these good things, I just do not feel right sometimes. I still can't sleep at night, I have panic attacks, I am often ridden with an overwhelming sense of guilt over every little thing, including stuff that happened years ago, and I have suicidal thoughts. (I have never attempted suicide, but I have considered different plans and methods. Usually when I get to that point I freak myself out and snap out of it, but it's a scary headspace to be in). 

Usually during my actual therapy sessions, I feel overall fine. I dip into these dark head-spaces frequently, but I also seem to come out of them quickly. Often she will ask what triggered these feelings, and I usually genuinely do not know. I literally just couldn't sleep, started crying uncontrollably, and that sent me on a downward spiral for two days. Then on the third day? I snapped out of it. 

Anyway, I'm wondering if I'm just a naturally dramatic and moody person who probably does not need to be in therapy... lol. I really think that most people probably deal with some level of insomnia and anxiety... Mine has definitely gotten worse as I've gotten over, but do I really need to be in therapy? *Does my therapist think I'm wasting her time and just looking for someone to bitch to about my overall good life?* She has never given me a diagnosis or really given many thoughts on my experiences. I kind of appreciate that she lets me talk through things, but I also wish she would be a bit more engaged... It makes me wonder if she just has nothing to say because she recognizes that nothing is really happening with me. 

Anyway, with all the above, I'm left wondering what I am really doing in therapy. What am I gaining from it? Should I be there at all? I realize this is not something anyone can answer definitively on reddit, but I'd love to know your thoughts.

I realised that I really don’t care for people, death means nothing to me, it feels like reaching the end of a book but with people (if that makes any sense) so it alarms my gf when she see’s me not having any feelings to deaths of people around me etc...people who tell me tragic stories or sad things I don’t empathise with and I don’t mean to be an asshole, but I really couldn’t give a shit about, I do care in some way, but I can’t seem to put my finger on how I care or if I even do, it’s very hard for me to explain. The only thing I seem to care about is my relationship and her feelings and mine, and I do get a lot of anxiety about if it will end, if she cheats etc. However when I try to think about a feeling of love towards her, I just feel like I don’t have that feeling even know I feel like I know it’s there, if that makes any sense whatsoever.

My motivation is gone, I don’t feel like doing anything except gaming every now and then or meeting my gf. I don’t care for going out or meeting friends, i could literally stay in my house for my entire life on my computer and that does somewhat surprise me knowing that I would be content with that, when I know there’s so much to expierence out in the world. 

The only times I have cried is during a break up of a relationship which confuses me, I don’t get how I can have all these feelings for a relationship get brought up when something like that happens, but then completely disregard everything else, I don’t know if this could be linked to something selfish? Maybe I am possessive and it feels like I lost what’s mine and that’s why I would get sad?

1.0,"Hi, I’m just here really to vent about how I feel on the edge with nowhere to go for help. I’ve been having trouble for a long time (with what I think is undiagnosed adhd tbh) and I’m just stuck.

I’m bad at college work even though I’m interested and I want to do well, I just can’t focus and then I feel awful bc I’m not smart. I’m not an interesting or fun person to the point where I can tell even my parents can’t stand me. I talk too much and always need to talk about things I’m into even though no ones interested. My sister makes it clear I’m annoying. I have some friends but I know they’re better than me and think I’m a drag really. I’d really rather be on my own than have to deal with feeling so unwanted.

It’s just, I don’t really get anything out of life and it’s too much stress and I’m just not bothered anymore. And everywhere you turn it says talk to someone but like who? My parents don’t think mental illness is really a thing unless you’re at like actual disorder levels. Although they did offer to pay for therapy after I had a bit of a wobble at home, but now my area is in tier 4 and I can’t do zoom therapy bc I live with people. My GP believed me about the adhd until he asked me why I wanted a referral and I said to fix the symptoms even if it takes like medication, at which point he said he thought I was wrong (high student population so lots of drug abuse), and that’s the first and only time I’ve met him. I’ve got the referral anyway but it’ll be another year and honestly I don’t know how I’ll talk through symptoms. I just can’t hope it’ll turn out right because 1) I can’t explain myself well bc I’m bad at speaking and stuff 2) I’m a girl and I know about diagnosis rates. 

I’m just, like over it. I don’t know what to do. I feel so lost and sad and I want things to make sense or if not just stop. But there’s no where I can turn for help where I’ll be believed, I can afford it and I won’t have to wait years.

1.0,"Past three nights I spent bawling my eyes out for seemingly stupid reasons. Yesterday it was because I remembered my pet that died about 3 years ago and decided I had not properly made sure that mentioned pet was happy when it lived. The guilt and disgust that I felt crushed me. Today I realized a game I was playing non-stop for the last few days had a flaw that to be honest shouldn't bother me that much objectively or even when taken into consideration that I possibly held a deeper meaning to it. I'm currently in bed in the middle of the night trying to calm down because I was thinking about it trying to fall asleep and just broke down. I literally asked myself minutes ago if my life had any sense to it.

I'm always scared of watching TV shows, movies, reading books or playing games. Whenever I like something I can't stand the thought of it ending. Once after finishing a game I had to stay home for a few days and comfort myself because I couldn't stop sobbing and hyperventilating and silently screaming from the mental pain that I felt. 

I didn't use to be this sensitive and honestly it's scaring me. I can't enjoy things anymore due to me being terrified I'll eventually have to drop it or go through another breakdown. Everything negative I feel is amped up and I can't function. At first I thought it was me not being used to feeling anything at all (I've been depressed for years).

Whenever I feel a certain way (*this* way), I tend to write down my thoughts onto paper. I’m not sure if it’s a good coping mechanism, but I guess it’s working, so that's good enough for me. The date is December 30, 2020, and I’m really fucking sad again. I can’t think. I don’t know how to put my emotions into words anymore. Writing usually helps, but this time I feel as if I’m writing an essay for college. I know what I’m thinking, but for some goddamn reason I can’t write it down! My brain’s in a million places at once, and I don’t know where to start. There’s so many things I would like to talk about, but I don’t have enough time in the world to get to them. Perhaps I should start with the most important things:

**I believe I have Bipolar II Disorder.**

I don’t know how to get it checked out. I might be wrong, so of course I’m not gonna go to the nearest cliff and cry wolf. However, I’ve done my research, and from what I can tell, I definitely show all of the symptoms. I know I’ve experienced hyperbolic episodes; I specifically remember nights where I had so many ideas for projects, I tried all night to get started on them. There was even a time not so long ago where I drove from my house in Ohio to Columbia, South Carolina and back in the span of under a day… with under 45 minutes of sleep.

There’s the unadulterated rage I get all of the time, which helped me become a great football player and weightlifter. I have serious anger management issues at times, and usually take it out on myself when I can’t put on the shoulder pads. I cut myself at times, punch myself in the face at other times. One time I even took a metal chair and bashed my head open. I do this because I put myself down too often. I’m an utter perfectionist to a fault; when I do something that’s below my impossibly high standards, I put myself down because of my mistakes.

There’s also many, many, *many* times where I suffered from depression, including as I write this. Whenever I get these feelings, I can’t even go to the store without feeling extremely anxious, as if a million eyes are staring at me, or making fun of me. I usually stay at home whenever I get these feelings. But then again, I am a college student, and I do have to go to classes; I feel terrible when I’m there, though. I constantly think of suicide, how nobody will care if I just disappeared, and how the world would be better off without me.

I wasn’t always like this. Up until my freshman year of high school, I was a pretty normal kid. I started to get bullied by some of the people that I called ‘friends’ in high school. They would call me things like ‘retarded’ and whatnot. As petty and as mild as this is, it really did and still does mean a lot; It did a lot of damage to me psychologically, and I never really forgave these people after the fact. I don’t know, I feel like an idiot for even talking about this. Moving on, sorry.

**I put myself down for the stupidest shit and compare myself to others.**

I started talking about this in the last section, but as I was writing, I felt as if it needed its own section. As stated previously, I’m a perfectionist, and I expect things to go the right way when I do it. Of course, I don’t expect *everything* to go my way; even I know that some things can’t happen, and I don’t want to be a giant baby about it. But for things I can control, such as football, weightlifting, singing, writing, et cetera, I expect it to be done perfectly. When it doesn’t go as I had planned (which is most of the time), the pure rage or deep sorrow kicks in. When it does go my way, I’m on to the next task, not stopping to celebrate my goals, or even be happy about the finished product.

I don’t know how to stop the perfectionist in me, nor do I know when it first started, but it seriously is a problem and I know I need to cut it out. However, I do like being how I am in some things, singing being one example. I absolutely *hate* the stuff I recorded earlier in the year, because I know I can improve on it. The same goes for writing: I did something for a local writing contest in the eighth grade. It was garbage! The other week I went back and revised it. *So* much better.

I also like comparing myself to others for no apparent reason. I can squat 485 pounds, which is pretty decent in its own right. But then I look at YouTube, and people are out here squatting 500, 600, even 700 pounds! While it is good motivation, striving to be as good as them, I push myself way too hard, and there’s a good chance I will injure myself trying to achieve their weight. The same can be applied to anything I do; I can’t even touch Call of Duty anymore, because I strive to be the best. When I die, I get extremely angry over it, and inevitably throw something and cut myself. I can’t have fun playing multiplayer games anymore, it sucks!

I don’t know. For now, I’m feeling a little bit better, so I guess I'll stop writing for tonight. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day. Here’s to 2021, I suppose.

1.0,"Hello,

I'm writing this post to see if anyone can give me some advice. I've been having this anxiety problem over the last few months. However, nothing I've read either online or from conversations from people accurately describes what I'm feeling.

A few months ago, I had a vacation from work. It was only 3 days, however, because of the corona virus situation, work had been pretty stressful this year so I was looking forward to this break so much. My girlfriend and I had booked a hotel in this small village in the mountains. On the first day down there, I was unbelievably relaxed. It had been raining a lot but I kind of like that. Riding the train and seeing the grey skies and cloudy mountains was so beautiful. I was also reading an amazing book and it was the first time I had felt really captivated by a book in months. I also remember listening to some beautiful music while looking at the landscape outside and reading. Basically, the first day I was so relaxed.

However, on the second morning, I got into an argument on Twitter. Now, I get into arguments with people online occasionally. Sometimes I feel I win the argument, sometimes I lose. I always get stressed by arguments. I don't know why I did I got involved in this argument, but I did it anyway os obviously I was stressed. If this argument was on a normal day (at work or at home), I would get annoyed by this for a few hours and then move on. However, this was different. I suddenly started to become incredibly stressed and anxious because I was worried I wasn't going to be able to destress and enjoy the holiday. Then, this anxiety about being anxious then started to become dominant. I started to worry what if I never stop being anxious this holiday. Then, I started to think what if I never stop being anxious over the next few months. I kept thinking about things in the future that I was looking forward to, and then I started to get anxious that I might feel this anxiety in the future, ruining these moments. Then this anxiety started to become automatic. It was no longer a conscious thing, it started to become a pre-reflexive anxiety.

Now, months later, I'm still feeling this anxiety. This anxiety has never stopped. Now, this anxiety is completely pre-reflexive. I have no control over it anymore. The worst thing is, this happens in moments when I am relaxed. All the things that I used to do to control stress and anxiety, are now the things that make me feel anxious. Reading a book, listening to music I like, riding my bike through the city at night, walking home to the sound of raindrops and summer insects, spending time with my girlfriend and cat, watching a beautiful sunset etc. All these things that made my life enjoyable and wonderful are now things that give me anxiety. If I ever start to feel relaxed, this anxiety automatically comes up.

Also, it's not only pleasurable things that give me anxiety. Now, it's any strong emotion that brings up this anxiety. For example, my cat recently went through surgery. Instead of being able to fully worry about my cat, I instead felt this blunt anxiety. I also imagined how if a close relative died, instead of being able to grieve, I would instead just feel this blunt anxiety.

This blunt anxiety has taken over all my emotions. and I don't know what to do. The reason why I haven't been able to find help online is most of the suggestions that are there to help with anxiety are exactly the things that cause anxiety for me now. All the things that I value in life and make life enjoyable are things that are being completely spoiled by this blunt anxiety. 

I want to make the point that this anxiety is not directional. There is no specific reason for it. In the past, there was always a reason why I got anxious (money issues, work etc). However, once I solved those problems, that anxiety was able to go away. This is instead always here, with no specific reason. I will be honest. I haven't had a bad year compared to a lot of people. I'm incredibly lucky. I haven't lost my job, my money and housing situation are okay, I have a great girlfriend and cat. My life is alright at the moment. This is why it's so frustrating that I feel this. I just want to be able to feel relaxed and enjoy all the things that I used to. I can think of more examples of when this anxiety comes up, but I feel like this post is already a bit too long.

Is there anyone who has felt a similar thing, or has any advice on how to help? Should I seek anxiety medication? 

TLDR: I'm stuck with this blunt anxiety that I have no control of with no direction that has taken over all my feelings. The things I used to use to relax are specifically the things that cause this anxiety.",mentalhealth,Anxiety Problem - Can't find anything that describes my symptoms,Personality,LD PF1.csv

1.0,"Hi, I enrolled into an English kindergarten when I was and then went to an international school because foreigners weren’t allowed to go to local schools and my parents wanted me to speak English because they can’t. So before that I could only speak Chinese.
However afterwards, when I was 9 I had to learn Chinese as a foreign language because our school had 30mins of Chinese and they put me in the best class without testing me and I can’t write a thing but I could read. The Chinese teacher was disappointed so she asked for my house’s phone number so she could talk to my grandma (those two soon turned into essay enemies because whenever she gave us an essay to write GRANDMA would write it for me and I had no choice but to copy because I couldn’t write a thing myself and at that time I couldn’t even type! So the Chinese teacher even ended up reading my grandma’s political thoughts TWICE &lt;—my little sis was the same) 
Once in Ch I was forced to write a 500word essay but I can’t with CH, I could easily do this with English  and with CH, my ‘essays’ or book reports looked like:
Hello everyone! Today I am going to talk about—- well, the teacher forced me to write this essay, I didn’t want to so yeah look at the sky the weather is very good... let’s start.
I think this book is very boring because I hate reading in general and it is in Chinese hahahaha don’t ask me more questions it even made me sleep so now I am only counting on the words to reach 500. Wait is it 500yet? Let me check....lalalalallalalalalala nonono it isn’t 500 yet so let’s put more fillers. You know how nice the weather is...

You get the idea. To this day my Chinese is still the same...But with English I could write it without fillers and I think in English...
So, since I was forced to learn Chinese, I hate it to the point where I avoid joining clubs that speak it...cuz I will be exposed to the language... yuck.however I am in Taiwan and I am Taiwanese and I am used to the international environment so it feels weird to only be with 1 race so I only join international communities.  I also hate it to the point that whenever an ad pops up and it is voiced in CH I will immediately mute it. Let alone getting a boyfriend unless he can speak English fluently without a foreign accent. 

However in East Asia and Southeast Asia,even ppl holding a PHD can’t speak English without an accent... unless they have the same background as me or they r from the Phi (some Philippines speak English without their accent, idk y) and sometimes Malaysia and Singapore.

And on FB, I ended up speaking their language instead because they don’t other speaking English after knowing that I can speak their language (I also can speak Japanese, Spanish, French and Portuguese and I am learning another Asian language) and they just gave me advice in their language whenever I posted a question.

It felt like time stopped and I've been reliving the same day over and over, except all my feelings were heightened with each passing day. Everything is intensified, and it could very well be PMS, but my mind has gone into overdrive on negative, looping thoughts.

At this time of the year, especially after surviving such a horrific year all around, it's hard not to reflect back on all of the things that have happened. Given that the majority of things that happened to me were negative (losing my job and having to move back in with my parents at 28, hence losing my independence; failed relationships at an all time high; not being able to do anything with my life and feeling like a burden and a failure at once), it's also hard not to take these things to heart and dwell on them.

Yes, I've passed my board exam to get certified, AND finished my thesis to get my Master's degree, but aside from that, the only thing going for me is being able to focus on my health and fitness.

In saying that, I realize how much more privilege I have than many people in the world, and cue the guilt.

On top of everythinf I need to process, I get the added guilt of not feeling thankful all the time for what I have (health and family), which then pushes me to suppress all those negative thoughts and feelings because I don't want to be any more of a burden on anyone by expressing them, 'cause ""many people have it worse, you should be thankful"".

1.0,"Not sure if this is where this goes, but Imma ask anyway. 

I () have had what might be auditory hallucinations since the end of my eleventh grade year. I’m not even sure if they are hallucinations even. It started out as simply hearing voices when I started to doze off as I fell asleep at my co-op while waiting for my mom to pick me up. That I just brushed off as me falling asleep and half dreaming. 

A few months after that I heard a voice from my phone one morning, I was putting it down to get up and I heard a distinct male voice saying “Fuck” or something along those lines. I, of course freaked out and went to my oldest sister (19F). I thought that someone had somehow hacked my phone and was watching me through it or something.  She went through my apps, deleted any odd ones and gave it back. And I pushed it to the back of my mind. 

A few months back, I had another episode, I was up way to late, (like 2 AM, which might have contributed to it) I put down my phone to finally sleep and this time I heard a woman’s voice saying “thank god, she’s finally going to sleep.” I didn’t mention this to anyone, and I forgot about it. 

Today, I came home, and went up to my room. As I entered I heard a very loud buzz, but as if someone was making a buzzing sound (and doing it badly) it only lasted a second. But it freaked the fuck out of me. I called for my family, but they didn’t hear me, and that drove me to tears. I know I sound like a big baby, but I was alone in my room, scared shitless of a sound coming from my bed and noone could hear me in my mind. Plus I have been paranoid before that people have been watching me in my room, or stalking me. 

My family finally came in, and when I told them  what was going on, they just sort of, dismissed it. I mentioned that I had heard a buzzing sound, and they tried saying that it was raccoons in the ceiling (I knew it wasn’t, he scuttles not buzzes) or that it was the electrics, (I have barely any wiring in my room). I kept trying to explain that that wasn’t it, but they just kept ignoring me. 

I have given up, they were talking about how, I might have subconsciously heard something like the buzzing and am making the hallucinations up on my own. (But they make it sound as if I’m doing it on purpose) And I’m really starting to spiral. 

Basically, I’m asking if there might be something wrong with me. On past occasions, I’ve been tired, or nearly asleep and that can cause Auditory Hallucinations I’ve heard, but this last time, I was completely awake. My parents aren’t the most open to the idea of Mental illness and I wanted to get other opinions before I press the matter, Thanks.

1.0,"So my therapist recommended to me that I should post on reddit. I'm currently 18 but the story starts when I was 16 in the summer of 2019. I live in the UK and it was the day I received my gcses. I did really well in them and I got 8 A*s and 2 As after a year of hard work and effort. I was at my highest point and I couldn't believe it. The day after however, my cousin tragically passed away in a freak accident in Mexico that should never have happened and I was suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of people grieving around me and panic surrounding how they were going to get his body back and many other things. Initially I thought I was doing okay but a week and a half later, I had my first panic attack. It was terrifying, I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die. This was my first introduction into my hypochondria and anxiety. For the remainder of the summer I was in a constant state of anxiety and panic - struggling to sleep, eat and petrified about death. During the gcses I was also getting close to a girl who was in my year (we'll call her Anna). However during the early summer Anna got with another guy and things died out after she told me we're no longer on things. After things didn't work out with that guy she messaged me again saying that she wanted to reset things with me (little to my knowledge she was also getting close to another guy during this time). When I went back to school I was still suffering from anxiety and panic - I was quite, unable to speak to anyone from how bad it was. During the first 2 weeks, I was getting close with Anna again and eventually we started to go out.

Initially things were going good, my anxiety started to die down and I no longer was having panic attacks. However soon the anxiety returned and manifested itself in different ways that weren't as noticeable with paranoia, fear and depressive episodes due to the fact that she wasn't exactly loyal in the past. Eventually with lockdown things started to get bad. She naturally has quite an abrasive personality but it usually was counterbalanced by her more tender side. However that started to change over lockdown and she started to become very toxic towards me - calling me unattractive, not her type, pathetic etc. This carried on and culminated in her out right treating me like shit where she'd refuse to even speak to me if she didn't like the restaurant I took her to on a date. There are way more examples and stories of this that I can give - even the time she sexually assaulted me which I don't want to get into. But I stayed, I loved her and being with her was the thing that helped me stop being constantly an anxious and nervous wreck. I saw her as the person that I went out with at the start not the person she became.

Eventually I couldn't bare it anymore and I broke up with her in October but now the skeletons in my closest have opened and all the feelings I had have returned. For the last 2 months I haven't been eating or sleeping well and I've been constantly anxious. I now also borderline have a panic attack whenever I see her at school too. I'm now seeing a therapist but it took a month - I didn't think I needed help, it can be scary but it can honestly be the best decision you can make.

1.0,"Hey all! I'd like to start this thread to maybe help each other check in on 'filling the cup.' My anxiety embeds itself as relationship anxiety and in-home anxiety, where being home too much makes me intensely anxious, feeling totally empty, useless and lonely. I have a hard time just hanging out (you can imagine what 9 months of COVID has done to me in this regard.) I've started making a daily practice of creating a 'Ways to Fill My Cup' list, so that I feel less empty and anxious. It's helping me A LOT to check out which things make me feel most supported and calm. I make a list starting in the morning and add to it if I do other positive things during the day. 

Example: Yesterday I had no plans, and the impending day of loneliness at home was looming dark and large. So my ""Fill My Cup"" list ended up pretty long. On it were things like: Finally doing my dishes, putting on the Chillhop ambient sound spotify playlist which was amazing for my busy mind, unpacking all of my Christmas items which makes my space feel more clean, spending time on my skin and teeth care which I sometimes neglect and then feel bad about, watching one hour of a comforting show, calling one friend, scrubbing neglected kitchen/bathroom spots with clorox wipes, watching funny animal videos, and more. This seems like a normal day of tasking, but since I also have ADHD, I often neglect things or am not consciously 'checked in' to doing them, so it has no impact on my emotional wellbeing.

Writing these items down so that I could SEE that my day wasn't totally 'wasted' in 'emptiness' was a huge deal for me. I spent time being productive and also time just being my own friend. Adding to it throughout the day kept me focused on the actual imagery of filling up my cup. My mind stayed relatively calm throughout.

Before this job, I had no phone experience and I had extreme phone anxiety (I probably have social anxiety which contributes greatly to it). It took me a lot of effort to push past my anxiety and start using the phone. I still have anxiety but I am better at dealing with it. 

Anyways, I was trying to help a customer, and I was feeling extra nice so I put in extra effort for this woman. Unfortunately, I wasn't experienced in one area of my job so I couldn't answer a couple of her questions. The customer said that she was tired of me not being able to answer her questions and that it is sort of ridiculous. She didn't thank me for the previous work I did either. I told her I would get her a more experienced person. I get it, I'm supposed to be an expert at my job, but damn it really crippled my confidence to hear her say that. I felt like I was working hard, but, in that moment I felt like it was meaningless. I put in effort and was rewarded with a negative experience and lots of negative feelings. 

The experience after the phone call was just me feeling sad and overwhelmed. I drove home after work and almost cried lol. I feel pathetic that I can't handle angry customers and I am second-guessing if this job is really going to work for me.

1.0,"Hi people of Reddit.

Normally I wouldn't find myself in this kind of position to write this but the fact is I don't even know how I should handle this now. I started a new job back in June while I still had another job that I enjoyed. I started to notice that I wasn't able to breath (I have asthma) and I used my inhaler a lot and it didn't help at all. Well anyway after a few doctors visits it turns out my anxiety was getting worse. At first it was mostly not being able to breath and it just kept getting worse. I had to quit the one job that I enjoyed because of reasons with the new manager that had just started working there. Anyway so I started putting myself into my other job working a lot and being helpful picking up other people's hours. I have a bag that I carry my medication around in and they have given me some problems with that as well. So moving on to being there a few months and I just find myself getting worse. My anxiety pretty much taking over my life. My depression starting to get worse again as well. I find myself struggling to get the will to even go to work. When I get there I have the routine of taking my medication with no help. While at work I find myself struggling to even be happy. Everyday the same old thing which isn't the problem then comes rude customers, customers who try to make me feel stupid when they are the one being stupid, customers with stupid jokes, and customers who feel they are entitled. I deal with them as best as I can. Next is the other employees who talk trash about other coworkers. Giving me attitude because I had a doctor's note to work in the least populated area of the store, a head cashier telling another person that I was faking it, and another head cashier saying that everyone has anxiety. Okay YES SUSAN (Her name isn't actually Susan) EVERYONE HAS ANXIETY WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU HAVE FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DYING OR YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T BREATH OR WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN BODY, I'LL WAIT. Anyway time after time my anxiety keeps getting worse. The area that was least populated now is closed due to it being out of season and I'm working as a front entrance cashier again. All I asked was not to have to go out into the isle and greet the customers. Not that I couldn't help customers or even greet them from behind the counter. They are saying it's apart of my job and it's like I can still greet them from behind the counter. They are giving me a hard time about it but there is also people who have doctors notes to sit down. They don't go to the end of the isle to greet people they sit behind the counter and stand up when a customer comes to check out so why can't I stand behind the counter and occasionally sit down when I have a bad disassociation episode. At this point I don't know what to do. They are being unfair to another cashier with anxiety and me. Anxiety ranges a lot and you should accommodate as long as it doesn't cause undue hardship (which believe me it doesn't). Plus with Covid it's not very smart to greet the customers because that makes me close to then and I could be at higher risk than someone my age. I just don't know what to do anymore everyone there is making so hard, that's why I decided to come to you Reddit users for some advice.

Today I figured out that my bills and expenses outweighed what I had in my account and I was really stressed about it. It crushed me because I pride myself on my own money management. That was the breaking point. This week has been filled with stress from my apartment complex (5 calls and they still haven’t returned my calls...) losing my car keys, neighborhood crime, figuring out how to move, working, and the fact I struggle with many health problems, lead to a very hard few days.

I have been meditating too and does not seem to help yet either. I have noticed after meditating I am more prone to feel my anxiety physical sensation with tension in head and stomach. It is best to accept these sensations and just keep on meditating. Or is it better to just try to make my self feel courage when I experience anxiety and these feelings?

1.0,"I'm a 17-year-old girl, nothing special really. I can't remember exactly when it started. Sometime in 2018, my depression has been, at least what I *think* is depression, on and off and getting worse as of recent. Maybe it's seasonal, I don't really know. I always have this constant feeling of heaviness inside, like a grey cloud that won't go away. My moods go from moderate to empty to extremely sad, and just as often as my feeling the thoughts and wanting to end my life come with them. I've lost motivation to do anything, nothing interests me anymore, I sleep way too much every day, and I always feel tired no matter how much sleep I get. It's also affected my moods greatly, I get irritated at the smallest things and it's caused some problems with my relationship with my parents and siblings...

I haven't told my parents *exactly* how I feel, just that I feel depressed, and I regret ever telling them. You see, my parents grew up in poor single mom households so they had to really toughen up to get by, especially my dad. I'm pretty sure he's bipolar, and I try and avoid him as much as I can. He always tells me to just be happy and to smile and that life isn't worth being sad over, but he says it in a very toxic manner. Toxic positivity you could say. When I came out to both my parents that I was depressed back in 2019, they brushed it off. I told them again months later, but then my dad decided to make fun of me and mock me for feeling depressed and that I needed to stop ""feeling sorry for myself"". He then continued to scare me into not getting any help because antidepressants would ""fuck me up big time"" and that I would end up like my cousin (who is on antidepressants and hasn't reacted well to them). More recently, I came out to my parents *again*, hoping that they would finally understand. I confronted my dad about his actions towards me and he apologized...up until a few days later he barged into my room screaming how he felt ""abused"" (due to me forgetting to take out the garbage that day), and started mocking me about my depression and how I was lazy as hell. His apology never meant anything. If you're wondering about my mom, she's been more ""understanding"" but hasn't done anything to help me until recently when it came down to me crying and begging her to get me diagnosed and get therapy. Even though she's more ""understanding"", she guilt-tripped me about how the way I've been feeling and how it affected the relationship between me and my family. I know the way I've been acting isn't the best, and I'm truly sorry for that, but it's not something I can control. By the way, she likes to guilt trip me, a *lot*.

Hopefully, I can get the help I need soon since we switched to a new insurance. I know that my mom will forget about it and I'll have to remind her constantly. Now that you have the context of what my parents are like, my main question is how do I deal with them and make them understand that I'm actually struggling a lot and I need their support? I'm afraid that even after, if, I get diagnosed/get therapy, my dad will still mock and make fun of me and my mom won't show me that she supports me.

1.0,"I know, I should probably seek counseling, and I fully intend to, but I am trying to self diagnose first. I also know a Google search will yield some answers, but I felt like letting this air out. It's a very, very lonely place to feel depressed when you're trying to maintain a facade together for everyone around you, and have been for decades.

At the most banal and superficial sense, I appear happy and successful. Good career, reasonably wealthy and debt free with an open path to semi-early retirement, with a wife and young child in a home in a nice neighborhood and a part time nanny to help. It could be PPD I suppose, but I haven't felt particularly ""happy"" for a long time, maybe ever. I just feel no love and affection for either of them - I think I used to feel what I could describe as love for my wife but I've just lost the joy completely in being with her, but I haven't outwardly shown that change. I have little to no emotion with my child, but because I generally have been able to do an incredible job masking my emotions, I play with my child all the time and cheerfully (outwardly) try to help out as much with the child-rearing as I can, while stifling any signs of apathy that I can. I feel nothing when I am with my child. No joy, yet no resentment either - it's just a job that I am trying my hardest to do well in.

I have loving extended family members that care for me and - again outwardly - I care for them. I drive them around (used to, of course - thanks COVID), run errands for them, buy them groceries in the midst of the pandemic etc. I think I would feel sadness for their sake if they passed away for sure, but I wouldn't feel that devastated if I never saw them again either. This honestly goes for my immediate family either - I would be very saddened for them if they were hurt or killed, but I don't know if I will really feel sad myself or miss them. Life will just go on.

Often times I do want to end myself, not because I'm particularly suffering, but because I just feel so little reward for what I am doing. So much of my life is just going through the motions of what I am supposed to do - work hard in school, get a good job, date a good girl, marry her and be a good husband, father a child and be a good parent. I experienced some feelings of happiness in the moment of all of these events, but little lasting joy. Of course, because it's an action I have to take meticulous planning to do, suicide is unlikely I ever go through with it. So much of my life was done and planned on focusing upon things I'm supposed to do, I have no idea how to really do something that I'm not supposed to, and that includes planning a suicide.

I have no real violent or malevolent tendencies and certainly derive no pleasure - mostly revulsion - to hurting other people. So, I am not really a danger to anyone but myself. I do not use drugs and rarely drink alcohol, and have never cheated on my wife. 

I have some interests and hobbies, but nothing I would call a passion. They distract the mind and keep me entertained, but I rarely am too excited about doing them. The only thing I have ever felt really excited and hopeful for was traveling to a new place and immersing myself in a completely different environment, if only for a few days.

No one in my entire life knows this side of me. Even as I type and feel this, I face a mirror and am able to fake the most sincere looking smile and satisfaction. 

I honestly do not know what next step to take. I think the feeling of numbness became particularly apparent that I have fewer distractions and just basically face my family all the time this year because of COVID - the need to fake it so often and all the time is wearing me down. If I had to choose a path for myself, I would probably elect to stay with my family and be the diligent husband, father and employee and live out the rest of my years. I would feel my existence though only serves its purpose for other people - and I mean no disrespect to actually charitable volunteers. 

I don't know what I have or what I am. I will make an appointment early in the new year to find out, but I just wanted to type this out and see what kind of response I get. Perhaps there is someone else like me who feels this way?  Perhaps someone else has known someone that experiences depression (which I think this is) this way? As in, not an active sadness, but a real disconnect and deep underlying apathy for life. 

Also, as if it wasn't obvious, this is a throwaway account, because like in real life, even on Reddit I maintain a sort of false persona where some friends know of my actual username. That account subscribes to a few subreddits discussing hobbies and interests of mine and I post frequently, but I consider them distractions more than actual passions.

Having said that, I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. This manifests itself in a cycle consisted of periods of productivity followed by periods of crippling depression, where much of the progress previously made is unraveled. Every time I find myself in the midst of a depressive episode I reach out to friends/therapists or develop new coping mechanisms to drag myself back to a semblance of normalcy. Within the last two years, however, I've found myself in a new country with many of my previous coping mechanisms now dismantled. The duration of my 'up' periods is gradually getting shorter and the effort to get out of my 'down' period is getting larger. As it gets more difficult to pick myself back up again, I've noticed my friends getting more and more distant. Finally, it's become too difficult for my friends to try to force me out of my depressive hole as I just fall right back in again.

1.0,"My issues with mental health can usually be traced to a female. I do not know why my happiness/self worth has to be derived from others. I’m an only child, have a successful career, do dope stuff all across the US and the world (pre-covid) yet I can rarely ever be happy when I’m alone. Which is truly sad because I am alone a lot. 

I doubt many will read this. And those who do will likely not care. But I found myself in a familiar situation over the holidays. 

I have had a thing with this girl for a very long time. We get along great together. We seem to get one another. We laugh. We dance. We express our true selves to one another, blemishes and all. I have honestly ended other relationships with great women because they don’t do it like this one girl can. They don’t scratch that part of my brain I cannot itch. Alas, there is a problem. She is the sister of my best friend. 

We have been intermittently romantic/sexual numerous of times. And as the days fade away, she always just says she wants to remain friends. That the complexity of the situation scares her. To which I am understanding. I don’t want to jeopardize what I have with her brother. He is truly my best friend. So the situation is less than ideal. 

Routinely I just go on with my life, find another mountain to claim or girl to relieve my sorrows. But I think this time is different. Over Xmas we hooked up, again. We were both wildly intoxicated. In the moment it felt right, perfect. She had just told me a week prior she wanted to be friends. Come the morning after it was awkward. She was cold, distant. Then a day later she made it known again that Xmas was a mistake. That she wanted to remain only friends. I was/am devastated. 

This brings me back to how this time I think it’s different. I feel more sad than usual about the situation. I feel broken. I’m so sad. I’m ready to just give up on a relationship and remain content with only myself. I think she may be the one for me but if we cannot be together all others will not suffice. 

I am trying to look at the positives. She’s great and we can remain close, but maybe not as a couple. But I long for that. Though I do realize I could be just romanticizing the possibilities. She knows how I feel but my fear of driving her further away prevents me with speaking my whole truth.

To summarize: I lost my job and my grandfather died in the same week. I live in another country with my parents, so part of the money I got from work I sent it to my grandpa's funeral. The catch is that the family did almost nothing for him.

 His body stayed in the house alone for nearly 5 hours or so, they're too lazy to step up and find a doctor. They said the hospital was closed, but my brother there went to the other entrance and found a doctor; my family's too damn stupid to not look around the corner.

Only two uncles, a cousin and my brother were there to bury him because I don't know what in hell the rest of the family were doing. I know that a week later my grandma and aunts were all sharped dressed acting nothing happened at all, smiling and partying like it's sunday...

My anger was such that I assumed that they died for me. They can assume I was buried with my grandpa.  They used the cash I worked for (we're gonna talk about my job in a minute)  on themselves. It's been two weeks and I still don't know what's the name of the cementery he was buried.

I was a waiter, that also worked as cashier, that also worked as cleaner, that also worked as deliveryman and on top of that I was a translator between the boss and the kitchen. I was under a lot of stress and panic attacks were usual. The waiters know what's up. 

The thing is that I got fired in a week. I nearly made 80 dollars. I sent like 20 dollars for the funeral and I can swear that none of that money was used on him. The rest I used it to buy rum and help with the electricity bill. 

I feel like shit, especially because I risked a lot, risked my ass arriving at dangerous hours to get home, sleep and then go back to work and got some nice panic attacks for that job to be used for hair dye and nails. I consider myself someone positive but it's hard to see the good here.

I've never felt so loveless, so abandoned, lonely, desperate, needy and angry in my whole life. I can't even spend time doing stuff outside because has beem raining for two weeks straight and it seems it's gonna be like that for a long time. I can't go on my bike because of that, and the bike helped me so much

I just want to be truly loved... my mom and dad are aware of this monstrosity, my mom is on my side. My dad not so much, maybe he's not done processing this or something. My brother is far away, and I only have family friends that are like family, but still feels disconnected. 

I can't see how this is good, or how it can get better. And religion is a good joke to me, Jesus wouldn't even know what to do neither. I don't have that ability to feel loved just because someone told them to do so.

 I've been hurt for a while now that I've become a shell, a rock. Incapable of crying. Just expressing myself through words...

I'll explain my situation. My mother and I are poor, and we always have been. I won't deny that a large part of this is due to the economy being in fucking shambles, but at least part of our poverty is due to my mom's various addictions. She's mostly sorted herself out now, but I spent much of my youth exposed to her drug habits. She still smokes both cigarettes and weed, and while I can sympathize, my frustration with the fact that this contributes to our financial situation is overwhelming.

Despite how poor we are, my mother absolutely insists on constantly moving and changing jobs. Over the course of my life, we have lived in over 20 different apartments, and made 4 moves that were more than 100 miles in length. Because of this, all of my friends are online. They've been a pillar for me in the lockdown, and helped keep me sane as my life rapidly went downhill.

In short, my mother has begun to use my name and identity in order to make more money for us, all while I've been neglected and parentified for upwards of 6 years. I've considered suicide multiple times. The situation I am in is severely unstable and staying here poses a very significant risk. I honestly can't put into words how awful it has been.

I lost 3 grandparents this year, (not due to covid), struggled really hard in university and overall just feel so lonely and my drained. I feel like I can’t think straight anymore and seeing my letter grades from school just absolutely crushed me. On top of that, I didn’t even get a high school graduation, just a random 20 minute video :(

I just feel so pathetic and lonely, I’ve never really had issues with school at all before, but online uni has been the most challenging and difficult thing for me, I feel like I can’t remember anything that was ever taught and during exams I get so nervous and panic and make super dumb mistakes. 

My sleep schedule is absolutely ruined, I struggle really hard going to sleep and during the school year would end up going to sleep at around 4-5am and would wake up for 8am online classes, which really affected my performance and understanding of what should have been easy topics. 

I’m so mad at myself for that because I really could’ve done a lot better if I actually got proper sleep, and I’m just so disappointed in myself and my overall performance in school. Thankfully I didn’t fail any classes though. 

Now during the break I’m just in bed all day, then I just sit around at my pc, try to play some video games but I don’t really find anything fun anymore.

After that i did have hook ups with some girls but its not the same thing they are like drugs make me happy and forget about my ex for a brief period of time and then all of a sudden i start think about my ex and im back to square 1.

The trauma that i have is so big that i cant like anyone im rather being single than being with someone Im very afraid of doing always the right thing on the relationship and despite that the person leaves me.

1.0,"So I have been suicidal a few times in my life. Only once that was pretty bad, and that was a long time ago. 

I have limited relationship experience as I've been with the same person (on and off) for about 17 years. That's a while. But any time those thoughts start sneaking in it's because he becomes abusive and it finally starts to get to me. 

I guess feeling like life isn't worth living because of the way someone treats you (he's a narcissist who has no idea he's a narcissist and who devalues me as often as he can... he figures out what might trigger me and then goes full-force any chance he gets. He has a horrible self-esteem but won't admit it, maybe even to himself, I'm not sure because he never talks about how he feels) is a red flag.

So, I'm wondering. People who have endured narcissistic abuse, and/or been in an abusive relationship, did the depression ease up once you got out of it?

My guess is mine would. I've read a bit about situational depression. These are the things my partner does.:

\- invalidate any of my thoughts or feelings that don't line up with the idea he has of himself of being a perfect guy in every way

\- basically intimidates me any time I am not acting the way that he feels I should be 

\- won't take any form of criticism 

\- criticizes me 

So, basically, devalues me often. Not all the time, but anytime that he feels threatened (which is often) then yah, it's the constant devaluation. I feel like shit. 

I do think that I am currently suffering from SAD but he's awful.

YOU shouldn’t provoke him, YOU shouldn’t hit him back because then he won’t have a reason to hit you back in return.” She never gave me the chance to explain that he was the one who hit me first for no reason, and I hit back as self-defense.

I don't normally make posts like these. I only read others posts and give feedback accordingly, so this is kinda hard for me. Its just that every time I try to think of a future for me, I only kinda see myself in a grave. I've been fighting for so long, trying to keep my demons from getting to me. Even people don't seem to care about my emotions feelings as they do to others. Everyday in my life has always been cold. So cold that sometimes I can't even feel my body. I give everything it takes to make everyone happy but none do the same to me.

Home doesn't even feel like home to me anymore. My parents always say that I have to do as I'm told without hesitation. A small mistake in my household can amount to a month worth of persecution. I've only kept to myself because of this. Everybody's opinions and matters are always given attention and respect all the time. Mine is the total opposite. They say I don't have the right to complain because they do everything to sustain my education my health. I really don't understand how shallow my parents minds are. So they mean to say that I'm only alive because of Education and Food? That's kinda stupid. Heck, I don't even have the right to be angry in my house. Even if I'm out, people constantly judge me for who I am. What do they even know? Nothing. They only see what they want to see.

I got a scholarship for her. You would think she would be content with what I am and what I strive to be. But for the past few years, she has gaslighted me, threw me under the bus and took sides. Few months ago, I had a big fight with my elder brother who always went out disregarding the pandemic shit and I thought mom and dad would get infected one day because of him.

I am an Indian girl in my country and what I did was never accepted so I can't even share this with anyone.

so 1 year ago... I went to my uncle's house (my father's brother) for my further education. I never wanted to stay with them as my uncles, his wife never liked me but still, I had to stay there, they have their only son who used to be my good friend since childhood.

let me share one important thing we never saw each other as siblings because we never met in the past we used to talk on Instagram si, nice 2015.he had a girlfriend already but still, he used to share some dank memes and some posts which were not appropriate to share with your sister and I was innocent I never knew he liked me as a girl.

so when I started living in his house....he started showing me some efforts that he loves me and proposed to me 5 times cuz we were friends I never knew what he wants but in the end, I thought he loves me so I accepted his proposal and started dating him(it's illegal to date your first cousin in India).but after some times I fell in love with him he asked me to have sex and as we were in the relationship we did it.
and after 8 months of relationship one day, his mom caught us .....and after that day she started making me feel guilty about it and slut-shaming and all she thinks that I am the one who attracted his son by showing my legs and body figure. look whatever I did was wrong or right I won't know but I loved him I still love him but whatever my aunt said about me is killing me every day.....I feel suicidal, slut and disgust is it a sin to love your first cousin?

1.0,"I don’t even know where to begin, honestly I’m hoping everything will just kind of work it’s way out without being too long. I’m a father of 4 boys and husband (common-law thanks to life so far) the last almost 6 years have been a consistent battle with being kicked down by life to where I’m running out of ideas on what to do to support my family. When my then girlfriend now spouse first moved in together it was good, and then we were expecting our first born and it was scary/exciting up until the last month where she had an affair, and that’s where the downhill starts. Shortly after we would welcome our son into the world and continue working through what happened. Following this as we started to build our family together while navigating being first parents as well as recovering from adultery I would become unjustly terminated from my job, and then abandoned by my union despite the case being air tight against the company. 

Our troubles really pick up here and I will try to navigate them as point form as possible. We would become reliant on Employment Insurance for the next year and struggle to make ends meet while I looked for work, upon doing this we had a mutual friend who fell on hard times and had him come stay with us. This would result in another affair more extensive affair that would take a long time to work through and navigate. Following this I was able to pick up some contracting work through road construction and start stabilizing financially while working on our relationship. A while after that we became pregnant with our second child that brought a lot of comfort and stability for the duration of the pregnancy and early parts of infancy. Shortly after he was born I landed myself a fairly decent job in another city and we made the move for it. Life here seemed to stable out a little bit with it never going to far ahead but never going to far backwards either but due to the financial stress and burden from previous years it was still quite rocky. 

This would go on for 2.5 years and then 2019 happened. In 2019 our pregnancy with our twins took an unexpected turn that had her emergency airlifted to another province in a major city 8 hours away in the middle of winter. The long story kept short is she became hospitalized for the next 8 weeks until she was in the best optimum time to deliver. During this I had to go on a leave of absence that cut majorly into our finances (we felt we could make it up once it was all said and done) while also finally having a needed surgery completed the afternoon before she was induced. (drove all the way there the next morning as well) Despite complications that almost cost us our youngest twin the hospital was as efficient as possible and although it felt like eternity we welcomed two beautiful babies into the world with one needing a bit more help. Once we were back home I was pending to go back to work once my surgery was healed from. After I had healed I was back to work for a rotation and a half (3 weeks) and then due to a declining market was involuntarily unemployed. 

Back to EI, this time with a significantly more expensive cost of living, babies who require expensive medication, and two older children alongside a larger more costly home etc. This only lasted beginning of June to the absolute end of November but nonetheless was stressful due to having not worked essentially all of 2019. What I thought was a saving grace and a fresh start would become an absolute nightmare. I would be verbally abused by my superintendent whenever alone, ridiculed for factors completely outside of my responsibilities, mocked and belittled when a family emergency arose that called me away, mocked for current financial standing when a vehicle issue arose that prevented me from having the ability to leave work etc. To summarize family emergencies our second child almost died to kick of February 2020 came back to work 24 hours later because we desperately needed $ to get bills back in control and he was stable, proceeded to have my hand fractured and try to work through it to then be mocked for having a breakdown when the shock finally sunk in on almost losing the little man, covid, vehicle repairs/tow from work site, torn ankle muscle from years of injuries finally catching up, our twins developing severe pneumatic bronchitis that could have been fatal... you get the picture (2020 sucked the most)

During the final crisis mention  I was finally lined up for a job in our current city that we had moved for years prior (the bullying gig I had was 2 hours away and I commuted for it every week with no lates/absences) and due to all the circumstance as mentioned I jumped at it, put in my notice and washed my hands. Only to then be ghosted by the company upon my start date and every subsequent day following. I have since had to submit all records of contact to our local branch for investigation as what happened is illegal but this process will take months if I’m lucky. 

So now we are back on EI with essentially no work in the last 2 years with the previous 2.5 years having been spent doing damage control from the last job fall out and I don’t know what to do. EI only lasts for a year, school is almost completely out of the question, my dream job to be an RCMP officer got a ways in but due to a collection having been in our recent history we have to wait for that period to be over and then I can reapply which due to covid even if approved could take years to get to depot. (Collection was a hospital bill that we never received from the twins air lift during the labour [insurance A was supposed to cover but forms never sent out by hospital and B they sent it to the wrong address and never followed up]) Due to covid jobs are scarce to come by.

No matter how hard I try, how disposable I make myself I seem to fail. Every time we finally start to get stable we get shit kicked practically to bankruptcy and it’s been nearly 6 years. I’m half way through my 20’s and I have no idea what to do, at this point I’m considering enlisting because it was always something I strongly considered before I met my wife and maybe it’s an avenue worth exploring. I don’t know if I’m supposed to ask a question at the end and I promise I did my best to keep it shorter as there’s so much that’s happened especially recently but my mental health is at its limit and I don’t know where else to turn other than typing it out. 

Currently I’m searching for work while also doing a creative hobby with the extra free time through Twitch (I was building a brand on YouTube back when I was in between jobs before the move 3 something years ago) and it seems to be helping/gives hope that maybe these digital media’s may also provide some form of stability down the road.

At the end of the day I feel like an utter failure the best of times and I truly understand the desire to just end it all; but I have a duty to my kids, my wife, my family, my friends, and myself to not give up and to just keep trying, it just feels like there’s an emptiness starting to get more of a hold each time.",mentalhealth,Depression gets larger valleys every year,Trauma and Stress ,LD TS 1.csv

Things stayed about the same for the last 7 years - I am cranky, fatigued, depressed, etc, but his hugs make me happy and relax me. There were fights and arguments, but what couple doesn't have that? I gave up the self-harm that remains as scars on my hands and elbow. I thought I was doing better, but apparently , I was just getting worse and harder to live with.

I changed jobs 5 years ago, and the problems abated for a while - I am good at what I do, and hate other people interfering and micromanaging, but who doesn't. Now, I have everything I wanted. 

Since we got married 4 years ago, my husband has occasionally threatened divorce if I don't, quote ""stop being a brat"" during arguments. He promised to stop after he realised how much that played into my anxiety, but he really just eased up on using it. 

At the end of Nov, I hurt my hand at work. I won't say how, but I will state that I had 3 weeks off, because I couldn't use my hand while there was an open surgical wound in the palm. I have nerve damage in 2 fingers, but I didn't tell him that, because I didn't want another lecture about me being arrogant and not paying attention to what I was doing. 

Those 3 weeks were the best 3 weeks I have had in a long time. I lost weight, finished 4 projects if been working on for months, we got ahead in our podcast, the house was cleaner than I had ever managed to get it (he usually cleans), and he said to me more than once that he wanted me to stay home all the time, because I was a different person, a better one, and much closer to the girl he fell in love with. 

I went back to work Dec 17. On Dec 23, we had a big argument. What it's about is not important, but he demanded I sit down at the table, and started laying out conditions of divorce. I was to go to my family Christmas and work out how to pay for the house (purchased in June) on my own, because I was to buy him out. That I was disrespectful and entitled and all this other stuff I don't want to repeat, mostly because I stopped listening to the insults when the tone sank in. 

I lost my shit. I started crying, pulling at my hair. I rubbed the palm of my good hand so much and so hard that the blister I left still hasn't healed yet. I pinched the back of that same hand so much it left bruises, blood blisters and I managed to gauge out some skin. Just to stay grounded and feel like I had some control. 

Eventually, he talked himself down (trust me, I was in no state to do it), and came to family Christmas with me, and there was no more of that talk. 

Well, this morning before work, I was in the kitchen having breakfast, trying to gather my strength to go to work. He asked what was wrong. I told him. 2 mins later, he asked what was wrong. I told him again, in a snappier tone. He told me not to snap, it was disrespectful and I should show him more respect than to treat him like that, that I'm just looking for a fight and he wasn't going to give me one. I went to work. A few hours later, I sent him a message when I knew he would be driving, so he could message me when he got to work, no buggy. No answer. I sent another message and asked if he was mad at me, and he sent a tirade that again used the words ""inconsiderate"" and ""disrespectful"", mostly due to me messaging while he's running the store. In response to my query of cider, he said we couldn't afford it with our dwindling savings, but he just spent $100 on weed and another $300 on DVDs in the last 2 days - i was just asking about a $13 pack of cider to share. 

I've reached my point, I'm done. I've spent the last 5 hours at work alternating between trying to figure out how to kill myself without making anyone I know find my body, and googling mental health services in the hope a free one will pop up that I can use to sort myself out. As far as I can tell, you either have to be on a politician salary or the dole to access mental health in Australia; a supermarket worker's wages are just not enough to pay off a home, pay bills, feed us and look after my mental health. Something has to give  and it's going to be me, as soon as I work out what to do with my cats. I've stopped doing the things I love because they make me feel worse because they're things with happier people in them (reading, writing, watching shows). I just want my life stable without all this fucking drama. I don't know how much more of this I can take before I drag a knife down my arm and say goodbye to my kitties. 2021 is the same as 2020 to me, just with different number at the end.

I left a really toxic marriage and as a result of that moved cities and changed jobs. Some of the people I trusted really betrayed me, it was just an awful time and I went through hell. 

I will never get over losing my dad but I've largely moved on from the rest of it. Overall I'd say I'm in a good place. But when I think about the people who betrayed me and some of the stuff that happened around that time I just feel so angry. I'm trying really hard to make my peace with it all and most of the time I succeed, but sometimes I lie awake at night thinking about some of the stuff that happened and my heart starts racing and I just feel so agitated and angry. 

I can't afford therapy so that's not really an option. I did try a few sessions of grief counselling but it almost felt there was too much to unpack, as it's not just losing my dad but everything else that happened around it. Anyway I couldn't afford to continue.

1.0,"I don’t speak up about my past often but those closest to me know the demons I have faced. I was reading an article called, “Post-Narcissist Stress Disorder (PNSD)”Written By Tigress and it really hit home for me. 

I know many of my friends suffer with mental health issues as well and may resonate with this as well. I share this because I ,like so many others ,often suffer silently and alone. I may smile and act okay on the outside but really I am falling to pieces. Not many people know that about me because I shut down and don’t let many people in. 

I have been distant from many people I care deeply about because I feel ashamed about how I feel. I feel as though I’m not good enough for them. I sit alone and cry. I don’t want to be social. Very few people are able to force me out of my shell. I mostly stay reclusive. 

After reading this article, I understand more about why I am the way that I am. 

You can read this if you want to understand me better. ⬇️⬇️⬇️

I was with this narcissist for over a year. During this time I found out I was pregnant. We had only been together about 3 months at that point. I didn’t want another baby nor was I ready for one. I was on birth control. This “man” fed me Antibiotics without my knowledge so I would get pregnant. To make matters worse he mentally and emotionally was abusive. Calling me fat (I was 130lbs at my biggest while pregnant) He cheated on me my entire pregnancy (I found out after the fact). 

After I had my daughter, he started getting abusive. I left him. He did everything he could to get me back and naively I fell for it. When my daughter was 5 months old I left again. This time for good. He seemed fine with this. We started working cordially on visitation for our daughter’s sake. I thought everything was fine. When she was 8 months old he asked me to marry him. I respectfully declined but what he did next was awful! He had visitation 10/10/15 and o was to get her back 10/16/15. That was when my nightmare began. 

I was getting ready to go get her and bring her home when I got the phone call that ruined my life. He had kidnapped her! Refused to bring her home and moved 45 minutes away. It took 8 months to find him and 2 more to find a lawyer to help me. I went 10 long agonizing months without any contact from my daughter. 💔 I was broken! Shattered! My son cried out for his baby sister (he was 5). 

When we went to court, his parents paid the lawyers and the judge off so he ended up with primary. I’m still fighting this monster 6 yrs later. 

It’s this nightmare that I relive! 💔

“Similar to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) people who have once shared their life with a narcissist may go through corresponding occurrences resembling the symptoms of PTSD. Maybe we should call it PNSD or Post-Narcissist Stress Disorder.

While it is common to have a period of adjusting and coping after a narcissist, for many these periods of difficult adjustments may continue for quite a while. With time, attitude adjustment, letting go of the narcissist and giving the narcissism back to the narcissist (it is THEIR problem and ISSUE, no longer yours) and taking care of you, such traumatic reactions usually get better and dissipate completely.

Anything can bring on PNSD even things as simple as the familiar smell of his/her cologne on a stranger walking by, a song playing on the radio, even certain foods. It doesn’t matter what brings you back to that terrifying nightmare … what does matter is that instantly &amp; out-of-the-blue you are transported back to a time in your life that was mentally and emotionally disturbing. These identifiers are called ‘triggers’.

THREE MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF Post-Narcissist Stress Disorder (PNSD)
1) intrusive memories of the narcissist — these may be memories that had a sudden onset caused by a ‘trigger’, or memories that are continuous and lingering
2) avoidance and emotional numbing
3) anxiety and increased emotional volatility

1) Symptoms of intrusive memories of the narcissist may include: 
1.Flashbacks of their narcissistic rages, images of intense rage or reliving the traumatic event for minutes or even days at a time
2. Suddenly questioning your own mental stability due to months/ years of abuse and/or gaslighting  when trying to perform everyday tasks or relating to others
3. Upsetting dreams about the narcissistic event
4. Difficulty readjusting your self-esteem and feeling good about yourself in social situations resulting from months/years of emotional, mental, verbal and oftentimes physical abuse

2) Symptoms of avoidance and emotional numbing may include:
1. Avoiding social situations, activities, people or relationships that you once enjoyed
2. Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the narcissist
3. Feeling emotionally numb towards life and love
4. Substance abuse or overuse of sleep aids
5. Memory problems
6. Trouble concentrating or performing simple actions
7. Distancing yourself or feeling on the apathetic ‘outside’ of conversations
8. Difficulty starting new relationships or maintaining close relationships
9. Cocooning or hiding
10. Hopelessness about the future or feelings of defeat

3) Symptoms of anxiety and increased emotional volatility may include:
1. Irritability, rage, temper outbursts or anger
2. Being caught up in the gaslighting mode whereas you may have difficulty adjusting to everyday tasks or questioning your memories, motives, and sanity. Self-doubt and loss of self-confidence
3. Overwhelming guilt or shame, self-blame or Stockholm syndrome 
4. Self-destructive behavior, such as casual sex with strangers, drinking too much, not eating properly, quitting your job, or doing drugs
5. Trouble sleeping
6. Panic attacks
7. Crying attacks
8. Being easily startled or frightened, jumpy and hypervigilant
9. Paranoia or imagining worst-case scenarios
10. Questioning others intents and genuinity, especially with new partners
11. Reliving arguments or narcissistic rages in your head”

If you have read this and it resonates with you as well...just know that you are NOT alone! You are NOT worthless and undeserving of love! You ARE beautiful! We are perfectly imperfect and that’s ok! People who truly care about us will be patient! People who truly care will try to understand that we need time and compassion. We don’t have to suffer in silence (even though we still prefer to fake a smile and put on this happy facade) 

DON’T GIVE UP! Have faith (even if you’re not the religious type) that things WILL get better! They can’t hurt you anymore! We are NOT just a victim anymore! We are warriors! We are survivors! 🙏🏻❤️",mentalhealth,Post Narcissist Stress Disorder (PNSD),Trauma and Stress ,LD TS 1.csv

I’ve recently been gaining more confidence and more of a backbone and I still continue to do so; however, the past two-ish weeks my mood has been going downhill.

I feel like no one in my life is taking it seriously (I have all of like 2 people in my life NOT including my therapist, and granted I don’t really talk about super super deep stuff about myself a bunch) but today has been the second day in a while where I’ve actively thought about suicide and death and dying. 

The feeling of loneliness is overwhelming me recently, being single and realizing I don’t have the second family I used to a couple months back and realizing I don’t have a person who loves me and CHOOSES me out of billions of other humans on this earth. And I’m really really hitting a wall hard, especially since I’m such a hopeless romantic and when I love anyone (romantic or otherwise) I normally love hard.

I’ve asked my therapist to maybe try and see if I can get tested for BPD, at least to ease my mind and she didn’t seem to take that concern seriously either (this was back in early November which was the last time I saw her).
And unfortunately a week or two ago I self harmed again after 9 months clean. And I continue to think about it.

I’m not sure if it was the increased dosage, the kind of world we live in, or maybe a bit of both but over the holidays I just kinda lost it. I was in an extremely depressive state; nothing was making me happy and I had no ambition to do anything. The last straw of it was a meeting I had with my boss who told me he was disappointed in my attitude and work ethic and if there wasn’t a change that they’d be looking for something else. I was completely ready to end my life, to put an end to the years of struggling. I had made plans to kill myself later that night, but I didn’t have it in me. I then told as many people as I could, from friends to my closest of family, and as of today I’m beginning my road to recovery. I’m still getting these thoughts once in a while, but it’s reassuring that when things get bad I don’t need to be afraid to tell someone. I’m happy that I’m alive.

1.0,"Right. I need to write this and it's not because of me, but because of you. All of the people who are going through tough times, no matter the odds. Here i've seen teenagers asking for the purpose of their own lives, why should they keep on going ...and not only the young ones, as much as grown men and women, with their lives fully in their responsibility.

Most people would say that our destiny is in our own hands. Well sometimes life isn't truly in our hands.. sometimes we don't have a say in what is to come and the only free will that we have is in how we react to the events that surround us and the experience we gain from these events.  
So here it goes, not to whine, but to share. Sometimes life throws us into extremes and we have to cope with that. As much as we can.

I was born in a small, shitty eastern-European country, filled with history and hatred. My mother was and still is a hardcore alcoholic, from which i have suffered from my birth to this very day - i was operated from severe gall bladder infection at the age of 3. Barely survived the intervention. My young, mutilated body and mind weren't aware of what's going on for many years and medical operations after, the only thing keeping me alive was modern medicine and educated doctors. (I will always be grateful to them.)

All the way to my late teens i had no idea how sick my body was, cause i had no real parents - my father has abandoned his child for the sake of his great business plans, which always failed, while my grandparents are all dead for decades, except for one grandmother who i never wanted to bother.  
So i did play with the other children, i did go to school, i did all the things that are supposed to be done by children. But all i remember is pain. Pain in my stomach, pain in my soul for not having a decent parent around. I lived through it, i finished high school and i went about the world like an untied horse (as the saying goes..)

i pursued my dreams of becoming a snowboarding instructor, in the same time i came close to horses and teaching people how to ride, i finished courses and have certificates on both fronts. Picked up the guitar, learned how to play a few tunes and how to grab attention, i even had a band and we made records.

It wasn't enough for 'life' and the Universal plan.. the first moment in my life that i had some kind of plan and purpose - i was in love with this very special person, she was everything that i can imagine of being the perfect woman in this world. She was kind, talented, beautiful, full of spirit and adventure, full of utopian ideals of humankind and energy to give out to the world.......

She died in the age of 21, while i was going to be 25. We were supposed to have my birthday together, but instead, she died.. she was buried on my birthday. To this day i have no idea what kind of sick joke of the universe is this, but since then i can't have a birthday.. or whatever of a celebration i have is way too pagan and filled with the Dead. Maybe it's the way it is supposed to be - me to be a host of dead people to have a party... i don't mind and i love them still, but sometimes it gets a bit grim.  


In the first months of her death, there was nothing for me but darkness and dread. I couldn't eat, water tasted like acid, people's voices were so far away.. the only thing i had was weed, alcohol and darkness. No one mattered to me anymore, no single soul could get me out of that pit. Couldn't hear music, couldn't see images in movies or series.. only very strong and dark literature from medieval and ancient times could get through to me.. as i saw people who went through ever darker things than me.  


The bad did not end there.  


She wasn't the only one to go away... as i was free from my 'parents' supervision from a young age - i had the freedom to travel and meet so many people, party, go to concerts of amazing live performances, make real friends... it was always an honor. I met amazing and beautiful, kind-hearted people... some of who died. From cancer, from illness, from car accidents.. now in my facebook i made a secret group of the dead.. they are not few.  


Losing the love of my life.. losing friends who were mentors.. losing friends, who i know i didn't have enough time to spend with... it is a burden. It feels like you need to live for the people who you lost.. but the energy and motivation is just not enough. How can a single person do all that has been left upon him by so many way too early departed?  


So in the meantime, while i was trying to coup with all the terrible things happening and trying to get my life and mind together - my father thought that i hadn't had enough of life lessons so he threw one more just for the fun... he made an official contract under my name (i signed but he didn't tell what) with my country in the baseline that i was working ...but when i understood what was going on it was already too late - the failed contract caused me thousands of Euro dept under my name and now i can't work or live normally in my own home country. Every cent that i get is sent to the government, cause of this.  


And all of that was before the virus crisis. I survived my own lockdowns over the past years. I know there is nothing more that the world can do to hurt me.  


I've seen the darkness from within. I know the worst pains there are in this world - to lose your love, while you still breathe, to lose your child that was the only future of your blood, to lose a parent before you were ready, to lose a true friend that you had not spoken to from the heart...  


There is no pain that can't be overcome. There is no trauma that can't heal. All you need to know is that there is more to life. There is more to give. Even if it is for a moment, even if it to change for the better the life of one person. Every last drop of blood, every last drop of momentum, energy and charge - you need to give. Not to take. Taking your own life is taking... taking opportunities to help, taking time that is not yours to give. It rightfully to the people around you, people who have been next to you, even if not understanding, people who you may never know, but still charge with the energy that you emanate. 

We have no right to take that away. No matter what we go through, even on the contrary - the more we go through - the more we need to share and help the people who are lost.  


Pick up your burden and carry it with pride. Shine through it. Build more. Build better. Build yourself and slash the thorns. Show the world what you are and what you can, no matter the scars. Show that being Human is much more than we even care to dream.",mentalhealth,"The heavy burden of depression, self hatred and absolute damnation. - My point of view and personal experience.",Trauma and Stress ,LD TS 1.csv

I have been considering doing it for the past few months, primarily because I feel the job I have been at since COVID-19 has changed me dramatically where I do not feel like the same guy I was in January or February.

Not to mention, I am making hardly any money (US $12/hr) and I am surrounded with a bunch of kids who kind of pick on me and harass me. The managers too have been difficult too. Treating me like I am a child and not a 20-something year old man with a fucking BA.

(( my room is next to my brothers room, and his room is next to my parent’s room ))



I come out of my room because my mum is telling me we have to take our dog on a walk. I go to my parents room but as I walk past I look in my brothers door and he’s crying. I’m very confused as my mum is in her room and can definitely hear him. 

I walk in and comfort him, I give him hugs and tell him it’s going to be alright ( this was extremely uncomfortable for me as he physically abused me for some time in my earlier childhood- I’m 13 and he’s 10 but I pushed through so already I wasn’t in the best mindset having had physical contact with him ) 

He’s crying and tells me that our mum shouted at him and that it made him lose his things in his game ( he flinched because she was shouting and misclicked, that stuff took him a week to get ) I didn’t think that was like her but I believed him as he was crying and then she comes in, shouting that Connor needs to get dressed because we are going on a dog walk. I can’t really remember what happened next but I next remember getting dressed and going down stairs to put my coat on. 

My brother had yet to come downstairs and my mum was getting angry. ( she’s not usually an angry person ) She started shouting at him to come downstairs. Then, we heard my brother crying.it was really loud and it broke me and I started to panic as she started shouting louder and louder, getting my dad ( who’s a fucking cheating lying abusing alcoholic fat ugly stupid cocky gross fucking cunt who should’ve been thrown out years ago ) to start shouting too. 

Obviously my brothers crying got louder and he wasn’t going to get dressed any time soon. I can only imagine how he felt as I was tearing up at this point. My mum eventually stormed holy fuck I can’t stop fucking crying my mum eventually stormed upstairs to my brothers room and started shouting ( she was telling me that he was fake crying but I don’t think he was ) at him “ WHAT THE FUCK GET DRESSED YOU FUCKING IDIOT OMG “ and ( I was still donwstairs ) shouted up “ HOLY SHIT PLEASE STOP SHOUTING “ I was at the end of my rope I was panicking and my brother was crying and I was gonna cry and I just wanted to kill my self and then she came downstairs. 

She looks at me and said “ I thought you wanted more consequences “ ( I had asked her to stop just letting things slide or joking about stuff my brother had done to me because at the time I said it, he was beginning to get verbally abusive ) and I said “ I said I wanted consequences not for you to shout at him because that was just plain mean” she said “ get out. “ and I did and then my brother cane down and we left. 

Once we were outside she said “ haha, well I’ve successfully managed to make both the kids cry today! “ my tears are burning my eyes hold on which I found really rude and insensitive because we are her kids 

She kept making jokes about it to my dad and eventually apologised to my brother

As we were half way through our dog walk, she comes up to us and said “ are you guys talking about how I just traumatised you both haha “ heads up I’m gonna go on a tangent 
That’s just fucking mean to joke about that especially when I’ve told her that I have trauma from her pig of a husband and her son and that trauma is obviously a touchy subject and originally I though she was making a joke about how I confided in her what my dad and brother had done to me but I texted her and apparently it was a joke about how she doesn’t snap that often so if you know what I don’t really understand the joke but apparently it was funny to her but it’s not like I have no reason to believe that she was making a joke about that because she’s done it before about my tics and she makes me feel bad about my derealisation also “ because I don’t snap that often “ but it’s been getting more and more frequent and she’s becoming more like my dad which is fucking horrifying 

It’s so hard to watch her be mean to me and my brother because she’s the only one in my immediate family who hasn’t given me trauma and she’s my rock but she always makes excuses for my dad and brother and I just can’t take this shit anymore 

I don’t understand her because she can just flip her emotions so easily one second it’s YOU FUCKING IDIOT HOLY SHIT and the next it’s aw hey sweetie :) like make up your mind it really feels like this all started because I came out as nonbinary..",mentalhealth,I’ve had a great morning :),Trauma and Stress ,LD TS 1.csv

I do understand how important it is to have loving, supportive friends, family, partners, relationships etc., but the fact is, YOU are the only person that wakes up in YOUR body and YOU are the only person that goes to sleep. 

These past 9 months of quarantine have been interesting, with lots of time for self awareness, solitude, to sit in myself and be with myself. I have learned a lot, I still struggle. I am healing &amp; I still hurt. I am getting comfortable with my identity, I still struggle with dysphoria. It is all apart of the life of being. The life that yes must have its downs, to know what the ups are. To know that the downs only last for a little while and then there we are, bouncing back up again. It takes time.

Sometimes I feel too secluded and wanting to chat with someone I used to talk to, or someone that has been removed from my life by God and the Universe that I want to check up on just because I feel lonely. We must be present with ourself in those moments and realize that **WE MUST NOT MOVE BACKWARDS BECAUSE WE ARE FEELING LONELY.** There are 1000's of people on the internet to chat with if needed, but realistically in those moments it might be best not to message anyone at all and just sit. 

I love speaking with people, I love conversing, I love communicating and experiencing different perspectives with like minded beings in other places in the world, but as well as I love my space and time for me; to paint, to journal, to meditate, to be outside, to play video games or just solely to sit.

Find whats right for you and focus on that. Connect with people that have unconditional love for you, if you are looking for people like that, go look, they are there and here. All around. I wish you a day of health, happiness and healing. **Together, Separately.**

I love you.

Anyway, I have quite a few good things in my life, including good friends and a loving family, but if you ask me what dreams truly get me up in the morning with the will to live, there are two (albeit corny) answers: pursuing a career in writing, and the idea of falling in love with the girl of my dreams.

In High School I decided I was going to make at least one of those two dreams come true, so I earned a writing degree and started posting my work online.  It was...marginally successful.  In the years since I graduated I've averaged a little under $10,000 a year between my own projects and freelance projects.  Then the pandemic hit, and my income completely fizzled out.  Now I haven't been hired since June and am living with my parents to make ends meet.  I was already getting fatigued marching forward on so little income, now I'm wondering what the heck will even be left after this whole pandemic subsides.  I made the decision a month ago to start applying for a regular old 9-5 job, but it feels like it's crushing me.  It's not that I dislike the jobs I'm applying for, it's just that this dream has been the one thing giving me purpose, the thing I've worked 80 hours a week for and poured my soul into, and it's hard to imagine relegating it to a side project I may or may not have time or energy for anymore depending on what day job I land.

Unfortunately, the love side has been even less successful.  Dating with social anxiety is hard, dating while gay with social anxiety is harder, dating while gay with social anxiety while also trying to explain that you're not financially stable right now is even harder than that.  Needless to say I still haven't found that dream girl and probably won't for a while.

I know my dreams are a bit childish, and I feel guilty that having a loving family and the essentials of life don't feel like enough, but the reality is I feel like I'm barely functioning right now.  I'm trying to move forward imagining a new life that may not have either of those things I wanted.  However, it quickly starts to feel like the life I always feared: waking up in the morning to go to a job I'm lukewarm about only to come home, slog around my apartment alone, and then go to bed so I can do it all over again the next day.

Now comes the ex-fiancee part.

I had lived with her since early september, up until she beat the shit out of me in november. 

She had decided to get drunk as hell and use me as her personal punching bag (literally) for the 2nd time in our relationship. And yes, I know it was stupid of me to continue on with her after the 1st time, but I just give the wrong people the most chances apparently.

That night/morning, my buddy picked me up and brought me to his house for the night. Next morning, I gathered up what she hadn't destroyed and left.

2 days later, filed for a restraining order, and after a lot of BS and continuances on her part, I finally got it. 

I thought I was doing ok, and I was healing. NOPE. Shit just keeps getting worse

Yesterday I learned that I was expendable before I was even gone..

The day *AFTER* my and my ex's court hearing, she'd already gotten into another relationship.. with someone she's known longer than me..

I'd seen his name show up on her phone a bit, but never thought anything of it..

So not only was I physically/mentally abused, I was most likely cheated on for the entirety of the relationship..

I’m stressed and deeply unhappy but can’t afford to quit my job and there aren’t many better prospects. I don’t even know if this profession is sustainable; I feel like I’m losing my soul teaching.

When I was the new kid at an elementary school and tried to make friends with a kid who looked  lonely, she was immediately aggressive towards me and soon said something along the lines of “No one will ever want to be your friend or like you. You’re gross, ugly, and stupid.” When I was in middle school and actually managed to get some friends, and introduced some of them to each other, they started to hang out with me way less. I remember in 6th grade I went up to a friend because he promised to work on a group project with me and he told me “go away and work on it yourself.” I got upset at him and all he told me in response was, “You know what, I don’t even want to be your friend anymore.” I cried during lunchtime and he had the audacity to get a lunch lady to tell me to “stop crying because it was making him uncomfortable.” Speaking of group projects, they have always been among the worst experiences for me. I got called too stupid for drawing poorly in middle school and I forgot how to do something in science and someone said “wow you’re not as smart as I thought you would be.” Group projects became hell in high school. No one wanted to be in the same group with me for one project, so I had no choice but to not only work 4 times as much (it was a 4-5 people group project) but also present to the class for four times as long while trying to overcome anxiety and the terrible speech impediment I had. I got a C(+?) mainly because of “my constant stuttering, trouble focusing, and working alone,” according to the teacher. In another project, I was literally locked out of accessing the presentation online because a group member felt “I was getting in the way” even after I helped bring information and organized it; they kept my contributions in tact, I guess they just didn’t want me to be there because they disliked me. There’s also the time when I literally just asked a question to my group (a different group that is unrelated to the last one) and the leader straight up told me, “Everyone here agrees and understands except you. If you can’t be on the same page, then maybe you should just leave the group” even though I had tried my best to be helpful.

1.0,"Needed to vent and seek a bit of advice I don't know of it belongs here. Please delete if it doesn't. I just had to talk to someone about this. I am  27 F pansexual. I have been with guys and I have been with girls. There have been some decent people and there have been absolute fucks. In this year from hell I was doing fine, there have been one or two casual relationships. But I was very content with myself. This is the year I decided to not get into an arrange marriage (it's common in where I live) and made up my mind that I don't want kids. Between cooking, learning new things and gazillion video calls like everyone else I was fine. Then came a boy.

I had known him for a while and then a work trip changed everything. I was attracted to him to the point of felt like I was a teenager again. There was something about him that felt simple. He was a simplistic guy who shared the same vission about life. He was kind, down to earth  street smart, smart enough to know his way around. He was a good friend, kinda meme buddy, we could laugh at each other's poor jooks like litte kids. I felt more authentic around him. He always texting me first when we were just friends. We spoke about our endgoals in life and we have lots of things in common (eg... Not wanting kids). After a long time I felt something genuine for someone and I completely fell for him.

There were multiple instances when it seemed like he might have felt the same way. So after flirting and seeing how things go for two months I finally told him how I felt. He was taken by surprise and told me that he hadn't seen me in that way. But he wanted to give this a shot. Told me wants to take some time. I was over the moon initially. But things changed drastically. He became extremely cold. He wouldn't text first. Stopped sending memes. Would give generic replies when I tried to make convo. It went to become from this to one word replies to single letter at one point. This time around I asked him if he's not into it, should just spit it out. I am not in for this half assed thing. Will be fine just being friends. He again assured that he wants to meet and give this a shot. However while I asked him out a few times in the past one month his answer was always something ambiguous as ""let's see"". When I pointed out that he's been terrible at communicating he told it's how he is (he's not, we used to text all day as friends) and he's sorry that I felt bad (what even). Nothing changed. At that point I knew it was never going to go anywhere.

Since then I have been treating him with the aloofness he has been showing me for the past one month. He's been replying to my texts taking the exact amount of time I took to reply. If it's 10 mins from me, same from him. I am really tired of all these. I guess he wouldn't make up his mind and say no. I could really use a rejection right now. Just tell me that you're not into me and I will be done. If he had done it in the first place I wouldn't have minded at all. I valued our friendship more than anything. But now it's been annoying and I feel like played on. I lost my friend in the process.

Someone gave me a really good relationship advice that don't go for the nice guy and look for the actual good guys. Know the distinction between the two. I want to learn from the past and meet someone good in 2021.Less drama a simple relationship for a change. My friend's advice came as an eye opener. Maybe he's been a nice guy and not a good guy. Maybe I was projecting my idea of him. All these have me questioning everything. Maybe what I thought was genuine humbleness maybe it was just tactical workplace politeness. Because when the power structure changed, as I confessed he went from nice guy to not so nice guy.

Next year I want to make better choices and not jump into anything. I hope to learn the difference between nice guys and good guys and someday I find someone who would give me their time and cherish my company.

Right now after a long time I am aware of my loneliness and it's a not a great feeling. All of my friends are in relationships and some of them have even started to move in together. Visiting my friends this time I was painfully aware that I am the third wheel and my life's gonna be pretty lonely. I hope I will find my rhythm back and not descend into depression.

I guess I made this post because I had to get this off my chest. I felt very stupid for a while, blamed myself fr catching feelings and in for not listening to my closest friends about not confessing my feelings to this guy. I felt very strange at points because there were times when I was depressed and he offered to be there for me. Telling me that it's ok to talk to him about these things. And then the same guy turning cold and simply replying ""there there"" when I tried opening up to him this time around. Something did not add up. This guy who would talk about our favourite movies and stuff till 2am and tell me that he can still go on when I would say we should get some sleep, now when I watched a movie he had been asking me to watch for months, his reply was ""O"". A single fucking letter. And I thought I was going crazy catching feelings for this guy while he might have never actually liked me even on the basic level.

I guess I am seeking advice on how to be normal again. Not see this life as a lonely one where I would come back home to an empty apartment after work. Right now life, it feels fucking long and difficult to make through.

1.0,Due to me having struggled with lonelyness before i constantly feel like i need someone around me. And now in the christmas vacation i have had friends over all the time and some even slept over. Starting school on monday and thats going to be hard as fuck also the girl that makes me happy leaves that that day. She lives on the other side of the country so i wont see her until summer. She makes everything feel good for a short term when we chill together. But as soon as she or my friends leave to go sleep i start thinking about stuff and feeling lonely. Fuck i hate my life.,lonely,Relying on friends and sleepovers,Trauma and Stress ,LD TS 1.csv
1.0,"Loneliness ruined my life. All the women I truly loved and cared about never returned that love. I settled for someone who wasn’t a good fit. And it’s been toxic ever since.  I’m 45 and about to file for divorce. No friends, no realistic chance of finding someone.  What’s the point of anything?  What’s the point?  How do the people around me find love and acceptance?

1.0,"I’m a 19-year-old female and I’ve never been in a relationship, but it has never really bothered me until the pandemic occurred and we’ve all been stuck inside all day. Basically, I’m always crushing on someone whether they be a classmate or a celebrity. Every crush I’ve had is with a guy I’ve never spoken to, so I’m only obsessed with the idea of him instead of who he really is. I kind of know I’m still not emotionally ready for a relationship, but I still like to fantasize about being with someone. Recently I’ve been watching this ‘90s sitcom and there was this actor who was around my age at time of filming who I thought was very good-looking. I spent a couple hours googling articles and reading interviews about him, and found out he is more deep than his television character portrays and he enjoys doing the same things I do. Now for the past week all I can do is fantasize about being with him, which is pretty ridiculous considering the fact that he’s in his 40s now and there’s no way I’d even be able to meet him and form a relationship with him. But all I can do is imagine him in his younger days and me being his girlfriend. I don’t know how to break out of this spell. If I had more friends, it wouldn’t even bother me that much that I’m single. However, the only two friends I have are a bit problematic. One of them is toxic and the other is more nice, but our relationship is very surface-level and we can’t connect. Basically you could say I really don’t have any friends. It’s very hard to make any friends because I’m at home for university due to the pandemic.

The people I work with do things that I dont find enjoyable or fun, and then they get upset because I won't hang out with them. I feel rather lost, and just wanting to find a friend or something.

This year has been the worst. Since i remember myself i have always been a bit sad but i didn’t think anything about it. Last year i changed shools and i had to make new friends. I lost my only friends because of my mental health problems, i started to feel left out and like im not fitting in this group anymore, even we where friends for at least 10 years. To one of the girls i told everything i thought about, how i felt left out and missunderstood.). I said that i didn’t like how she acted and other stuff. After that she called everyone and turned against me. She told them that im not normal. (There where multiple times that we went out and i felt really sad or ignored. When i quietly left they always were super meant to me about that but i just didn’t want to ruin their night.) They always were so fun and everything but since we changed schools they started to act different.  In new school i made few friends but they sometimes make fun of me- they comment negative things on my clothes, they sometimes make negative comments about my looks- like im not pretty and why i would thought that im pretty enought for that boy. I of course ignored that and always tried to be nice to them. Even when they were annoying- i never said anything ,but if i did something wrong, they would make me feel bad about it. As they have a lot bigger following on social media they didn’t include me in photos or posted pics where i looked bad. Every boy likes them but im just like the ugly friend. Im 17 and no one has even once asked me out or anything. I never thought of myself as being ugly but now... im not so sure anymore. I try so hard everyday to look good and im nice to everyone. Since quarantine, nobody has been wanting to talk to me. They only hmu when they need homework or something from me. I want to leave them but i know that they are gonna turn everyone against me. I really don’t have any real friends and i don’t wanna miss out on my teeneger years. I know that when im gonna be older i will be sad that i missed out on those years but i really don’t have anyone. For the past 2 years im always at my home, crying every day. I even haven’t been to invited to any party.

I have found out that talking about it really helps me, but I can only talk online about this. My social environment doesn’t like talking about it anymore and I don’t wanna bother anyone.

1.0,"I never imagined being a victim of abuse would make one feel isolated from the world. For it to feel like no one understands, and you’re in this completely alone. People don’t want to talk about it, they get awkward and uncomfortable when you talk about what you’re going through. So they change the subject so they won’t feel uncomfortable anymore, not knowing how crushing it feels to have ones issues shooed off. You try and seek help and even those who are abuse survivors can’t lend you advice. That’s how deep in shit I’m in. That even those you’d think would be supportive and encouraging won’t say a word. 

All I want is for someone to listen. All I want is someone to be by my side and be there for me. I’m not asking for them to get me out, or save me. All I’m asking is for someone to be there. Someone to listen. Someone to gather up enough sympathy to say “hey. I’m here.” I don’t understand.. ever since the abuse came back I realized how isolated this is. How I’m on the other side of the wall, and everyone else are on the opposite side. Even when I wave and call for company, they look, and keep walking. It makes me doubt anyone really cares. But I won’t fall into that deep hole of being cynical. I know people care.. they have to. They just don’t know what to do or say.. so they’d rather keep walking.",lonely,I never knew how lonely it felt being a victim of abuse.. until now,Trauma and Stress ,LD TS 1.csv

1.0,"I've been neglected, abused, and lonely my entire life from family and friends. I've never truly felt like I belonged anywhere even when with partners. I have never had a good holiday because of people yelling, calling cops, drama, ect. But this year is the first year I've had to spend it alone. I am all the way across the country from my family and friends and my partners have left me home alone to visit family events I am not invited to. I've never felt so much anger and loneliness ever before this and I don't understand it. It's not like it's any different from any other year. I guess this is the first time in 29 years I've physically been alone Instead of just mentally. I don't know what to do and has made me resort to just getting drunk. I am trying to get over my anger of loneliness but I don't know if I'll be able to get over it and move on with my current partners but leaving them would mean being utterly and completely alone in a state with no friends or family.",lonely,Never felt so lonely during the holidays,Trauma and Stress ,LD TS 1.csv
