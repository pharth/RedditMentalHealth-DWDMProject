i got in a lott of trouble at school because i would get enraged when someone pisses me off or just get really angry even about little things it was crazy how many times i had to change school because i was too agressive  i changed 5 schools when i was 14 i had managed to control my anger a little bit better but still not that well i started to have problems with my head because i always talk to myself even when i was 9 years old because i thought it was normal i still do it till this day but i always talk to myself i started issues talking to people like seriously i still cant open up to people nor talk to them, and at that time i started to hate most people around me my parents included i literally hate them to the point i had murder thought but i never will or gonna do it ever .

i even thought a lot about killing myself and just be done with it all , cus at that point i was just done . now fast forward im 16 now still have all those thoughts and more  including : i feel pretty depressed ,anxious , stressed out ,and idk about this one but i get really cold when i get angry and

holeli,1635680061,1,"There's so much anger in my home right now. It's nearly filled to the brim. My partner and I are both extremely depressed, we have a lot of financial issues and other stresses which include our 7 month old puppy who we think is going through adolescence. 

Even if it's adolescence, we have been lazy with her training since we got her desexed last month so I feel that we're just reaping what we've sewn there. 

We've both been out of work because of lockdowns. We've had car problems that's lasted months. Puppy broke a window, and the window is one of those windows that's hard and expensive to fix.

 I've had medical issues that ice been ignoring for a very long time. Under a doctor's guidance I tried to wean off my anti depressants to switch to another but with everything going on it just made me full on suicidal. And angry. So fucking angry at everything. I get so damn angry when my puppy is misbehaving and that just makes me feel horrible about myself even more. 

I let her out to pee at 5 in the morning and she went off her fucking rocker at some birds in the backyard and wouldn't even pee. She wouldn't shut up. At 5 in the morning in the middle of our dead silent neighbourhood and I wanted to fucking kill her. I was so angry I just started bawling and had a meltdown. 

I've stopped weaning off my meds and just settled at the amount I got to. I can't handle the withdrawals at all right now.

And my partner has been so fucking depressed and angry too. I get angry when he's angry. He yells at his games and it pisses me off to no end. He keeps making jokes about unaliving himself. 
I think he picked it up from me when I was telling him I felt suicidal. But I'm worried and I don't know how to help him.

I know we're hanging on to life for each other. But I know we both fucking hate life right now, and we'd both rather be dead. 

I'm so exhausted by everything and everyone. It feels like we can never catch a break. 

We have a house inspection at the end of the week and I'm worried the landlord won't want to continue our lease. Or that he'll want to up rent a stupid amount. We take care of the property and there's no reason to not continue our lease unless he wants more money. But if that happens then we're fucked. Renting is fucked right now. Might even have to move back home with my dad at the ripe old age of 27, how embarrassing.",depression,My home and my head is full of anger,2021-10-31 22:34:21

Jaguar_pawl,1605418561,1,"I’ve been a calm person most of my life. I’ve even been one of the most patient people you can meet. One flaw I have is that I have this seething rage that builds up when something goes wrong. It doesn’t always happen, but when it does, my body trembles, and my breathing pace quickens. I can feel my blood boiling, but the most notable feeling I have is this feeling that there’s something in my chest/stomach eating away at my insides. I don’t get violent towards people, but I punch things, break things, throw things, and even hurt myself to try and feel better. I get so angry that I feel sick, and my body tends to feel exhausted afterwards. My mind dwells on my feelings for a very long time, and I feel like I can’t think of anything else. 

I hate feeling this way. I feel like I’m abnormal, and sometimes dangerous, even though I wouldn’t hurt a person. I never want to hurt people unless they threaten the lives of my family or friends. I always go I to a deep depression after these episodes and I feel worthless, and that I don’t deserve the family, work, or friends that I have. I become walled off from the world, and it’s nearly impossible to get me to talk about these feelings. 

Sometimes I’ll even feel strong misanthropy. Even then, I don’t want to hurt people, but I wouldn’t care if some people died. In my normal mood though, I care a lot about people. I don’t want anyone to suffer in this world. 

I want to stop feeling this way, but I have no idea how to stop it. People tell me “Just stop being mad” and that is just fucking WILD to me. How do you just STOP being mad? I can’t turn it off, because if I had that control, I’d never want to turn it on! 

It’s becoming so strong again that I’m beginning to hate myself. I feel unworthy of spending time with my family or with my friends. I don’t even want to meet up with my friends tomorrow because I feel like I don’t deserve to go out and have fun. 

I feel like I should cry, but I can’t. It just won’t come out. I’d appreciate if someone can give some tips on how to manage this anger. How do I stop it from consuming me? How do I act normal, even when I’m angry?

Sandizzle5,1587396057,1,"Hi All,

For about the last week I've been struggling to break out of an anxiety relapse that, if I'm objective, has been fairly moderate compared to past ones, but when in the midst of it I'm finding it hard to keep that perspective. I had an urgent video session with my therapist yesterday and she feels it's just a situational episode and it will improve with time (bit of background, I'm not on any medication, I've only been doing CBT and talk therapy for about the last year).

I've been trying to make some changes to avoid my triggers and am trying to work on being easier on myself as my therapist suggested. Yesterday I'd noticed I'd almost spiraled while doing my usual 60 minutes of exercise on my stationary bike, fast forward to today I woke up feeling ""delicate"" mentally and physically so I decided perhaps to skip my workout today entirely, which made me feel good for about a minute, then the guilt settled in that perhaps I was just avoiding it because I didn't want to risk giving myself an anxiety attack. What do you think, should I push myself to get on the bike or is it truly self-care to give myself a day off?

Finally, does anyone have any affirmations they love to use? I think I accidentally threw my list out and am looking for some recommendations.

Most of the days i have no energy at all, i used to be a very active person, liked doing exercise, but lately i been avoiding it. I also get constant negative thoughts, and need to be always occupied to avoid them. I have never been very good at socializing, im very introverted, but lately i also fell like it became worse, after having conversations with freinds, more times that i would like to admit, i start thinking over and over again about the interactions i had, and cringe to myself. I also hide my feelings and problems, most of people i interact with must think im always happy, when in fact its pretty much the oposite. I also started to think some of my freinds secretly hate me, fell like they been avoiding me,  i think i try too hard to seem happy and freindly and come across as fake. When the negative thoughts are worse, i think about hurting myself to get away from my problems but then i think about what my family would go trough if i did that, and thats why i think i would never be able to hurt myself.

CuriousStellar,1562245872,1,"Hi guys!

I posted a week ago about my anxiety going through the roof cause of a depressed friend not answering me after a serious talk. Well, turns out she was sick, so... Yeah. However, I'm still worried about her, cause I know she has the tendency to not answer her messages when she is stressed/depressed/anxious. I am having the feeling she is doing this currently, since we have our exams next week, and I'm worrying a lot about her.

Now, I want to help her get professional help, since I believe she needs it (and so does she). Problem is: I am pretty anxious myself and the last time I approached her about a serious topic, my anxiety spiraled out of control and I believe I have taken the wrong direction of trying to help her - my approach was about productivity rather than approach this from a mental health point. Now I want to correct that mistake and finally really help her, but I am scared it could come off as invasive.

I'm currently making up a plan in my head which looks something like this:
1. Wait until our exams are over, cause neither of us need that stress during the exams. Meaning, the earliest point to talk would be the weekend of next week (20./21. July).
2. Get in prepared. That means: Get a list of possible therapists for her (I know where to get that, since I'm currently seeking for therapy myself).
3. Since it can take forever to actually get a therapy place (up to half a year), maybe prepare a list of self-help groups too? 

Does this sound like a plan you'd consider helpful? As I said, I know she thinks she needs professional help too, but probably struggles with actually making appointments. 

Also, and I know this sounds egoistical, does anybody have tips on how to cope with my own anxiety during all of this? I know physical activity has always helped me to some degree, but I worry those thoughts might haunt my nights again.",Anxiety,Helping an anxious/depressed friend while being anxious yourself,2019-07-04 23:11:12
MangoSalsa48,1582674966,1,"I was doing well the past few weeks. The best I’ve been in the last five years. 

Saw a doctor. Got diagnosed. ADHD and depression. 

Started taking meds. And keeping my room clean. And cooking. And spending time with my family. 

I remember a few days ago thinking, “I can finally feel it. I can finally see why people want to live.” It welled up in my chest like flowers blooming. 

But Sunday was a bad day, someone said something about people wanting to die and I closed my eyes and all I could see was me, dying, over and over dying, graphic images I didn’t want to see, more vivid than they’ve ever been. Always trauma to the head or neck, a dozen different ways, explosions and tears and slices and strangulation and so much. Just so much. Cycling. 

I couldn’t open my eyes for a minute. I couldn’t open my eyes and for a few seconds it felt good, and then something shifted and it hurt so bad. My throat hurt and my eyes burned and tears came that I did my best to hide. I was with people, I was with so many people, and I had to stay with them for hours. 

Images blurred inside my eyes. Every time I closed them the pictures were there. I died a thousand deaths and kept conversation flowing through my lips while I drowned in them. Even when I couldn’t see anything anymore apart from my head being crushed, ripped from my shoulders, blown up from the inside out. 

I waded through the rest of the day with a scream in my throat, a half step away from a panic attack, smiling for an audience I didn’t want to lie to. 

Sunday. 

They’re still here. It’s hard to tell whether they’re with me or I’m with them. I can make them go away for a bit, if I’m going and going with loud music in my ears and fully encompassing tasks in my hands and eyes and feet. I’ve listened to a lot of ACDC. I’ve gone grocery shopping and made meals for the week and cleaned three rooms of my house. 

The second I take a break, I try to take a breath, my throat starts to close up and my eyes tingle and they crawl through my skull from my ears, forward and back and up and down and everywhere, they’re everywhere. I have no space to run from them because they’ve found every corner of my mind and painted it.

It’s 2 am and guess what? It’s another sleepless weeknight, you lay in bed scrolling through your favorite social media app to distract yourself from your own thoughts. Time is winding down and you know sooner or later you’ll have to shut that phone off and descend into the darkness of your own mind. As you watch that one last video you get a sinking feeling of dread, you know what’s coming. As you set those alarms and take one last look at the time, you sigh a deep sigh and roll over to the other side of the bed. As soon as your eyes shut, thoughts come racing into your head, it’s almost instinctive at this point. Then comes the feeling you’re all too familiar with hits you like a bus. The feeling of a knot being slowly tightened in the pit of your stomach and seems to worsen with every passing second. You toss and turn but with each movement, you only make it get worse and worse, you’re almost at a breaking point. There’s a battlefield roaring within your head and your thoughts are racing.

“What am I doing” “am I enough” “why am I such a piece of shit” “She would be better without me” “How many mistakes have you made? ” “People shouldn’t trust me” “I don’t trust me” “ Have I really changed?” “Am I going to hurt her?” “Are my parents proud of me?”

You think to yourself, even more, it runs deeper than that, you’ve blocked out the trama that’s haunted your past. But guess what? It’s back. You feel worthless, used, and not worthy to be where you are today. It’s been another hour 3 am now, you have to be up in 6 hours, but you know your mind won’t guide you to the paradise of dreams you long for. You’ve had enough, you can’t take it anymore, you want to let everything out, all of the emotions and tears you know you feel, but nothing comes. All that comes is a dead, blank stare shooting from your eyes, it’s like staring at your own grave at this point. You know you don’t want to die, it’s the last thing you want. You know the people you care about would be shattered, and plus you don’t want to miss out on your future. You’ve got sweet plans! But the sweet satisfaction of finally resting sounds appealing, no stress, no anxiety, no worries.

As you lay there and stare blankly into the darkness that has swept your room, you realize that there’s nothing you can do to fix this. Out of anger, you scratch your forearm as hard as you can but as the pain explodes like a firecracker, you forget about your thoughts and that never-ending tightening knot in your stomach. You shoot up and realize this, but as quickly as the knot faded and your mind was at rest, it returns. So out of curiosity you try it again you scratch deep leaving red marks running up and down your forearm and you chuckle to yourself. Is this how I fix myself? You can feel the knot loosening ever so slowly every time you drag your nails deeper into your skin. Your mindset isn’t “you deserve this for being shitty” You do it because while that pain is surging through your arm, it causes you to forget about the warfare booming through your head and that never-ending knot that won’t go away. The only thing you can focus on is the pain, the very same pain you used to run to your mom crying about when you cut your knee. You describe the feeling as walking into a cold AC room during the blazing heat of the summer. Sounds nice right!

But now It’s 4 am, you’ve calmed down and your mind has slowed. Tiredness has overwhelmed your body, but your brain isn’t ready to power down yet. A thought crosses your mind lying there, “What if my nails aren’t enough?” “What if I need something more?” You quickly disregard this thought as you think “Well, I’ll get there when I get there, then I’ll figure it out” You know this is a bad habit but it’s the only solution you can think of.

Then out of nowhere, you fall asleep, you’re not sure how you fell asleep but it’s morning! The bags under your eyes seem twice as dark compared to the previous day but you tell yourself. “It’s okay!” “Another day another dollar” You don’t even think twice about what took place the night before, it’s all too natural. You use people and your phone as distractions during the day, nothing about the night before crosses your mind, you bury it deep inside yourself and you act as if life’s great! You’re cracking jokes and trying to impress the people around you so just maybe, they don’t see how truly broken your mind is.

Bangbanggarcia,1652160252,1,"I've always known I've wanted to jump from a height. I've thought about suicide on and off for over 10 years. I've been alone (No partner, no friends) for a lot of the those years. Now I'm house bound and I hate myself fuck being kind who I am is not acceptable to me anymore. 

I feel so at odds with myself and I honestly don't know if I can turn it around which = hopelessness. And as we all know with out hope there's no point. 

I have tried this year, gym 5 times a week, working which after 18 months of being a recluse wasn't easy. Essentially it's all boiled down to a skin condition I don't know how to handle hence the 18 months reclusive spell. Funny thing is when my skin is calm I've been told I'm very pleasing to the eye. Unfortunately those moments last a couples weeks at most it's a real headfuck.

I remember being told by my neighbour why don't you have a girlfriend your beautiful like a woman. I told him I was shy and he couldn't understand. I've not been able to get to look that (normal) since and can't even look a woman in the eye. Weird I get attention in the gym feeling as terrible as i do but a pair of biceps doesn't make a confident man.

I haven't had sex in almost 10 years apart from a cuckold session at a nude spa that was just weird. I've become a weirdo who flashes my adjacent neighbour(s) selectively all grown women but that's not OK. And though I've on more than one occasion been flashed backed what that essentially makes me is a voyuer and exhibitionist with depression, anxiety and OCD. Today my neighbour was not so pleased and for the first time I realised that that's the extent of my life I have no other kind of relations with the opposite sex. Reason being I have no confidence because I believe I look like a monster. Not sure it that's true but I do know this skin thing can make me look HELLA different from my intended self.

Please don't judge me I'm not a monster infact I'm shit scared of women I've never opened up like this.  I'm just being real because I might not be here in the next few days. 

For all those years I haven't been able to live even a modicum of a normal life beside working. Ill never get those utterly wasted years back.

Life is a competition to be the best. Back in Middle School I had the best grades in my school, never a grade below an A. Now I'm 18 and feel like a failure. My 19th Birthday is in a month and I dread it every second. I can't see myself at 19. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 15. This quarantine only made it stronger. I'm high 24/7 and even then I feel like shit. But the feeling intensifies when I'm sober. I hate myself I really do. I was spit and beat on and verbally abused as a kid at school and babysitters home. My self esteem is dependent on other people. If someone tells me my legs look weird then all I will think about the whole day and I mean it very seriously it eats me the fuck up. I might be bisexual, whenever I get gay thoughts I punch myself and get high but the thoughts come back. I might be a masochist, I have intense daydreams of being taken advantage off and being a slave to a master. I can't be like that I can't. That's not the person I want to be. Girls only care about money and fame. I already been laughed at most of my life for looking feminine and being skinny imagine when people find out I have a pegging fetish. I need to die as fast as possible. Suicide is on my mind from the second I wake up to the second I fall asleep. I don't deserve to live. I wanted to be like Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci (my idols). I am a very fast learner, extremely artistic and creative, but I hate this existence. Life is a lie. I wish I was never born. I'm forced to play the game of life all because 2 people were horny 18 years ago. I want to slit my wrist or hang myself in front of the whole world to show people what society does to people. My whole life I just wanted to be happy but the only happiness I found is in weed and right now I ran out so until I pick up some more I'll be daydreaming suicide. Goodbye

GarbagePailKid1980s,1594514467,1,"&amp;#x200B;

*I've been thinking today about loneliness, solitude, and why we have any need for relationships, etc - some scattershot thoughts.*

*I'm going to cross post this on FA30, where it and I belong.*

*This is more of a ""thoughts"" post with lots of tangents - As it happens I have felt prone to feeling loneliness my entire life long, though I won't write much about that for now.*

One thing which I think is interesting to ponder is that those who identify as ""not often lonely"" report spending about eighty percent of their free time in the company of others, but so do those who identify as lonely. The vast, vast majority of lonely people it is fair to say are not in any way socially isolated. Another factoid: Those who have seen another person in the last day are more likely to consider themselves to be lonely than those who haven't.

This seems completely counter intuitive, but it points toward something that is so obvious about loneliness that it actually prompts another question why it is routinely overlooked.

Aloneness is often related to but is never synonymous with loneliness. Our need to form relationships with others, and the expectations held for any such relationships will always vary by our personal disposition. Some people have no one in their life and feel no loneliness (though that absence of affect might, of course, have evolved as a survival mechanism in a trap of isolation, a situation not unusual for older FAs). Others people have many, many connections with others and yet still feel loneliness. There is a saying that ""if you feel lonely, you are lonely"". It does sound trite, but it is perfectly true: loneliness has no other referent than itself. Loneliness describes an inner feeling, and not an external situation. It is perfectly possible to be surrounded by people and to feel deeply alone.

Because, of course, beneath the surface of things, beyond the people and purpose we clutter our lives with, we are all deeply alone in this life. There is always going to be a bridge between the self and others that can never be crossed. Eg: If I stub my toe on the corner of this desk, someone can certainly empathise, maybe because they too have stubbed their toe, but the experience of it is mine alone. And that expands to every moment of my life, from birth to death, from the trivial upwards. Even with the most loving companion, there is a part of me that will remain forever sealed off, a part of me that cannot be shared, that is effectively stuck in a state of persistent aloneness in this world.

The awareness - whether it is repressed or not - of being thrown into existence, with no real purpose or point, and with only finite time until the end, is always lurking. Always part of the background of life. Loneliness is probably not about what is lacked in life, but about *who one is*: a social being who is unable to find fulfillment of social needs, who moves through life carrying unmet needs. The urge for intimacy is a desire to do away with as much of that gulf between people as possible, though the closer two people become the more that impenetrable barrier reveals itself.

This is what is meant by Yeats when he writes: ""The tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul"". Sexual congress is almost always trivialised nowadays by its hedonistic focus, though when not for reproduction sexual congress isn't truly about a search for pleasure - It is humans twisted together in to a shared state of longing and yearning for something *more*. Something out of reach. Something beyond ourselves. Souls desperate to touch each other, but forever beyond one another's reach. That is why the most passionate sex always involves biting, clawing, etc. - as if we are trying to get what is there under the skin.

[https://imgur.com/CGf5kls](https://imgur.com/CGf5kls)

Loneliness then is a temperament, not a situation. It is one which says that my need to connect to others, to be understood by others, to be heard and seen - *for it to be recognised that I even exist* \- surpasses what the external world is currently offering (or maybe even ever able to). It is a temperament more common among women, or at least reported to be - that isn't a dig. Studies continually show that women are more prone to feeling lonely though isolation is a *much more significant factor* in male suicide. Loneliness effects women more regularly and persistently, but it tends to effect men more fatally.

Though to some degree, loneliness is a sort of drawn out tantrum about our lives: to expect others to ever truly ""get"" us, to ever be truly ""understood"", is in some ways asking of the world what is impossible. We are alone, and it can never be otherwise. Loneliness expresses a partial desire to return to our childhood -where every need will be met, every whim and thought heard and respected. But that is a paradise that was burnt up in adolescence.

It is not immediately obvious why we need ""connection"" with other people at all, but it is clear that high levels of loneliness are statistically associated with *substantially lowe*r levels of satisfaction about life. Loneliness is also associated with cognitive decline in later life, with elevated levels of depression, and with sexual promiscuity (an escape route more accessible to females), etc. It is said to shorten life as much as 7 cigarettes a day would, though it is hard to quantify how and why that is so.

I think it's worthwhile to tease out the related terms that tend to be used interchangeably:

**Aloneness** \- Being alone is simply a descriptive state of circumstances. A few people are resigned and content to living life alone, even if they might have wished circumstances were different. One can be alone and *not at all lonely*.

**Loneliness** \- Isn't really an emotion in itself, it's an admixture of longing, yearning, craving for social connection, of having unmet social needs, or a sense of discontentment about the unsatisfying relationship one is caught up in, etc.

**Isolation** \- I would say that isolation is life lived on the other side of chronic loneliness. It is the state of loneliness when one has moved beyond any remaining hope of salvation. Loneliness is, in an odd way, fueled by a sense that life could be otherwise - but one can't keep yearning for connection that is never coming. Isolation is the realisation that one is likely abandoned in this world, and that feelings of loneliness have become, ultimately, fruitless. I think isolation is to loneliness what FA is to being single.

**Solitude** \- Solitude is best thought of as a positive, of being present with yourself, rather than being absent of others. Solitude is a deeply undervalued state, and our society wrongly militates against it. There should be more acceptance of and encouragement for solitude. There is huge value in being by oneself, and away from others.

\*\*

So what is it that we are even gaining - or would hope to gain - from our ""connections"" with others? We could, after all, live perfectly efficient though entirely isolated lives. Especially in our modern age, there is no necessary reason for any meaningful connection with others in our private lives. We could live out our lives and die in perfect safety, and comfort, without needing to speak to another person at all. Yet most of us would, obviously, consider that to have been an entirely impoverished life, a wasted life in fact.

I think there are a few reasons why people yearn for relationships, and these are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

""Why all this noise and fuss? Why all this urgency, uproar, anguish and exertion? Why should such a trifling thing (as love) play such an important role in our lives?"" (Schopenhauer)

A. To Keep up with the neighbours. ""There are some people who would have never fallen in love if they hadn't read about other people doing it"" writes Rochefoucauld. I think there is some truth to that. There are so many people in relationships, or not but seeking them, for much the same reason that they are climbing the career ladder, etc. There is a social script in their hands, and they wish to stick to it. We are taught from birth that relationships are the ultimate end in life and that we should all dedicate a huge part of our energy to finding and maintaining one (this actually isn't untrue). I suspect that many people's prime motivation, esp. young people's, for being in a relationship is to conform to this social expectation

B. Sex. What better way is there to get ready access to sex? Monogamy is often impugned, as ""unnatural"" for men, which makes little sense as there is obviously no better way for an average man to gain access to regular sex

C. Distraction. Relationships with others are probably the best distraction life offers. In a kernel in space and time two individuals can come together to create for each other years and years of drama, of adventure, of shared experience, etc - and all literally from nothing but that initial flirtation. One might say that two people in a monogamous, loving relationship are two people lovingly *wasting the others persons time*, in a unspoken pact against the universe. This has to be set against the background of everyday life, of society and beyond, which is *totally indifferent* to every aspect of our lives. A relationship is almost a sort of conspiracy people enter into together: ""You will matter to me, and I will matter to you. And will you matter to me because I will matter to you. and this will mask the reality that neither of our lives in the long run really matter at all""

D. Relationships provide the best ground for balancing our desire to be independent and our desire to connect. This is Jasper's theory. Every human probably has those two drives: to stand apart and to belong to something outside of or greater than themselves. Someone who is lonely has moved too far in the direction of being apart from the world. Relationships enable us to connect to something, to someone, outside of ourselves - and often in the most intense and intimate way. Yet we still maintain our sense of being self sufficient, of being independent, etc.

Love is the most efficient way of bridging the gap and bringing together two separated souls.

E. Recognition. Does the self even exist, in isolation? A big part of who we are is how others see us, how others respond to us, and how others relate to us. If we live in isolation, we never really become who we might have been, because the more developed part of human personality is probably formed in our relations to others. Love doesn't make us blind, it lets us see things we couldn't have seen before - parts of ourselves that were hitherto latent, hitherto unrealised. We probably crave relationships because there is a side of us that can only be accessed that way. When we do not nourish that part of ourselves there is always a lingering sense of our *missing something*, of a part of ourselves wilting and withering away - That we are somehow incomplete, or only half human.

Rounded humans are humans who can tolerate or thrive during moments of solitude, but who can also form and forge meaningful connection with others when the moment is right. Either of those extremes is not healthy. Aloneness is probably necessary to find out who we really are, but relationships are often required *to become or to practise the reality of* who we are. You can be the most loving person in the world, but if there is no one to love...you can't be. You can be the most affectionate person by temperament, but if there is no one to hold and to snuggle with... you aren't. That part of yourself is a dead end. Many FAS (introverted people in general) are probably much more attuned to their underlying feelings, their wants, needs, etc, but much less capable of forming the relationships actually required to express or bring to life those things.

I'm just thinking aloud here.

The problem for older FAs I think is as follows: how do we obtain the benefits of relationships without having any realistic opportunity to enter relationships? The benefits would include - feeling that we have worth as people, that others ""recognise"" us, that we are ""seen"" and ""heard"", etc. That we have some sort of closeness and connection to the external world, or others in it, rather than feeling ourselves slipping toward a sense of isolation, or abandonment, etc? There are obviously ways to obtain traces of these things - friendship, volunteering, etc. - but I don't see how the heights of human intimacy can ever be obtained outside of a loving, intimate, relationship. That side of life is probably not reachable by any other road. There is a reason that people do not settle for friends, because friends do not fulfill the diversity and depth of need that people have to bond and belong. The life of the FA is probably a life forever on the margins.

**""I want to be lonely no longer, to learn again to be a human being. Here I have everything still to learn""**

Nietzsche

**“ Man is alone because he is man! In some way every creature is alone. In majestic isolation every star travels through the darkness of endless space. Each tree grows according to its own law, fulfilling its unique possibilities. Animals live, fight and die for themselves alone, confined to the limitations of their bodies. Certainly, they also appear as male and female, in families and in flocks. Some of them are gregarious. But all of them are alone! Being alive means being in a body — a body separated from all other bodies. And being separated means being alone.**

**This is true of every creature, and it is more true of man than of any other creature. He is not only alone; he also knows that he is alone. Aware of what he is, he asks the question of his aloneness. He asks why he is alone, and how he can triumph over his being alone. For this aloneness he cannot endure. Neither can he escape it.

eccedentesiast13,1568291707,2,"I've been thinking of dropping out of school for years now ever since I was in 6th Grade. At the time I didn't mind it much, but wanted to be homeschooled instead because at least I was still studying, just not in school but at home.

Every year (ever since 6th grade) there was always a thought of dropping out of school. Especially when I was in 7th-8th grade, I always found excuses not to go to school. My mom still doesn't know that majority of those excuses were lies, because I knew if I told my mom I wanted to drop out she would get mad at me and give me lectures and all that. 

My thoughts of dropping out kind of stopped when I was in 9th grade because I was finally moved into homeschooling. This homeschooling was different though, you had a choice to go to those classes they have once a week, and my mom didn't ask me if I wanted to go to those classes, she just made me go to them. I got mad at her for a while but I realized I was actually fine with it because it was actually kind of fun and even better than my previous school. 

Moving on to 10th grade I was getting the sense of wanting to drop out again. I didn't mind it though, because I felt like it was just because of schoolworks and how stressed I was. But throughout this timeline (6th-10th grade) I only realized now that my mental health was getting worse and worse every year. I didn't know and still don't know how to deal with it.

I'm currently in 11th grade and I really want to drop out. I've been trying my best to not think about it, telling myself that it's most likely because of schoolworks and all that. But honestly, my mental health is getting worse every single day. I honestly hope I was exaggerating about that but I'm not. I don't really know what to do. I want to tell my mom that I want to drop out after the 1st Sem ends. But I'm too afraid to tell her because I hate explaining why, and I'm pretty sure she won't allow me to.",mentalhealth,I want to drop out but I'm not sure of it.,2019-09-12 22:35:07

B12 comes back well, even though I suspect I am low sometimes.. I have never tested magnesium, so that will be interesting. Testosterones was once kind of low, but since is higher and decent.

ari_es0412,1606841301,1,"I'm a 21F. I don't have my driver's license yet. I live in a pretty rural area where there's only one bus that I can take if I want to go to the nearest city. The bus stop is at around 30 mins from where I live and it does not pass regularly. (Like once every 2-3 hours). So as a consequence, my parents are the ones who drives me to work and to the bus stop (when I needed to be at school before the pandemic lol)

Now I've completed my driving lessons last winter (I had started them in at the age of 17, so a couple years ago, but I took multiple breaks in between due to anxiety and lack of motivation). and I passed my writing test 2 years ago. Two months ago I had built up the courage to finally schedule my final test (the road test) to finally get my driver's license (and some kind of independence) but the more I think about it and the more I believe I am not ready for it yet and I am strongly thinking of cancelling it. (It's supposed to be in 10 days). 

I stil have a big lack of confidence whenever I drive (because I don't drive often) and I get so anxious whenever I have to drive to some place that I don't know how to go. i.e. I would not mine driving to work since I know exactly what roads to take, where they are, where there's an intersection, a stop, and things like that. But driving to someplace I've never been when I don't know what to road is gonna be like, is giving me anxiety. 

So yeah, That's it just wanted to rant about it I guess. Does someone relate to this kind of anxiety??

tropicofvera,1557436981,1,"this post is long to everyone who read all of it and replies thank you from the bottom of my heart i have no friends or anyone to come to help for that's why i'm writing this. i want to burn my skin so badly, i want to starve myself until there's nothing left of me, take all my pills and drink all the alcohol i have, and forget my memories, forget all my trauma i just want my torture to end, I can't keep living with BPD (borderline personality disorder) anymore, i want to shoot myself in the head and for this misery to end, I'm going to end my life.  


I'm sad, I'm hurt, I feel betrayed, I feel a lot of anger, I feel everything and nothing.   
I thought things are getting better between me and my girlfriend (they've been not good for a few weeks after we had a bad fight) , turns out I'm just delusional and everything she told was a big lie, she knows I tell her to always be honest and how bad my BPD and trauma is from lies and abandonment from my past relationship that was extremely traumatizing to me and still is to this day.   


Out of nowhere like a bomb she says she's felt suicidal past few days and can't stop all those bad thoughts about our relationship not changing, how numb she felt at night, I panicked so hard I started feeling sick, anxious, crying, I tried so hard to push through these extreme emotions to try and be there for her in that moment as much as I can, for about two hours I tried to give her all the reassurance I could, every possible thing I said she dodged and shot me with negativity non stop, since I have BPD I started feeling worse and worse, I tried offering her my help and all I can to be there for her yet she kept saying bad things to me how she doesn't believe in us and how her therapist tells her to leave me if I don't get better,afraid things wont change between us and so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told her the past few days I was able to control myself, I tried proving to her I can change as much as I can, i planned going back to therapy when im with her, take pills to stabilize my mood and that things can't ever get better if she'd rather throw what we have away like it's nothing, if she constantly talks about leaving, my trauma flashed before me as it was happening and at some moment I snapped, I felt the same way i did when my ex told me he no longer loves me even though he kept lying that he did and it came out of nowhere, i didn't want to be the same used old doll she doesn't want anymore and yet still pathetically beg her to stay when she only talks about leaving, I couldn't take it anymore, I couldn't keep listening to her trashing our relationship like all it was is bad things when for the most part it was good when she herself told me this so many times, all her good words just seem like lies whenever i think of them, its not her being suicidal that made me snap and tell her to leave, its all the other things, i would've done everything i can but i couldnt for hours reassuring her when she trashes out relationship in return and i get not even one positive thing in return, my BPD just snapped, i can't believe for the both of us, i need something small back.  


 I couldn't keep trying to be there when she doesn't want it and tell me she's not committed to this relationship and it means shes not ready to move in (like 3 weeks before it happens when its all we talk about and her saying how excited she was) until she's better, why should anyone try for someone who isn't even committed? I snapped and I told her to leave if she wants to leave this bad and I'm tired of trying to be strong for her when she only says bad things. When all she does is look for reasons to not make it work, to not be together, to point at others and say we are gonna end the same. after I told her to leave she said ""so much for fighting for me"" and it made me feel so much anger and hurt because that's literally all I was doing in that moment, is fight for her even though my BPD was horrible i was shaking and crying and feel like vomiting  


I feel like trash after that whole conversation, of course after she said ""so much for u fighting for me"" she goes and blocks me, acting angry with me as if I didn't just basically try to keep her with my as if my life depends on it, I have my limits and I couldn't take it anymore so I told her to leave because all she says and all she does is show me that's all she wants by saying these things and that its too much for her (like in every relationship ive been in) .  


 There's no part of her in that moment that made me believe that she loves me anymore, that she wants to stay, that she wants this work, she showed completely the opposite and it hurt and it felt like a betrayal to our relationship. That she thinks so low of our relationship and then lies to me about how happy she is with me and how excited she is to live with me, every single thing was a big fat lie, she doesn't love me, she doesn't want to be with me, she doesn't give a fuck about this relationship, all she does is look for reasons to leave, she's the same as everyone else I've been with, the same lies of someone promising you they'll be with you forever, the same lies they'll love you even through your worst.   


she was the same just as any other relationships I had, she abandoned me and didn't stay with me through the worst, she didn't love me through my worst and instead nit picked on every reason to leave. I have done many mistakes too that probably lead us to where we are, like yelling when i snap or cuss but she has done many abusive things too and yet i always forgave her for it and looked past those mistakes, if she can't see past mine and see the good in me all i could say is to tell her to leave, despite my mistakes, I was committed to changing myself, planning to go back to therapy when i'm there and keep working on it instead of throwing her to the trash like she means nothing.

 maybe i deserve this, maybe I AM this horrible that i don't deserve real love, maybe i don't deserve to have a relationship where two people stick together through thick and thin. i asked multiply people about this situation including my mother and everyone said that she doesn't appreciate me and that she's being manipulative and whether that is true or not, i still love her with all my heart and remembers all the time when she was sweet, caring and there for me and can't stay mad because i made mistakes too, we all do but the difference is i still would've fought for what we have, i still would've spent every single day with her to try and fix it instead of throwing it all away but she doesn't love me as much as i do. we are both mentally ill but it didn't stop me from wanting to keep working on what we have and believe in what we have and now i feel like a fool, like i gave my trust to someone who was going to abandon me anyways, like i opened up in every way just to be thrown away like a used toy that no longer serves purpose, that the moment i am not good enough to keep someone happy i'm no longer loved and just a burden.",SuicideWatch,I'm extremely suicidal,2019-05-10 07:23:01
Cherryonme,1659884065,1,"Let me preface this by saying I didn’t plan to commit suicide or anything. But last night, when I was watching Netflix for two hours with my partner, I wanted him to hold my hand throughout the show which is what we usually do. But it made me question myself “Why am I this clingy?” Throughout the show, I didn’t pay attention to it at all, my mind was racing and thinking about my life. At this time, I was drinking 2 glasses of wine. Bear in mind, I don’t drink alcohol very often, 2 glasses of wine is enough to make me feel sick. 

So for two hours, I was recollecting moments in my life in which I realised, I’ve always been alone or abandoned, abused. But I never remember these moments until last night, only some, but I’ve learned that people tend to forget their traumas as a defence mechanism. So when it all came out in my mind, I felt an immense emotion that was just uncontrollable. 

I have a big family, 10+, so you can easily be “abandoned” by your parents or siblings. All of my siblings, have been either emotionally or physically abusive to me when I was younger. I’m now 23. 

It could literally be as simple as an older sister who was in the same school as me, reprimanding me for wanting to sit on the waiting area for our stepdad to pick us up because it was embarrassing to sit down there. 

Then a brother would call me a prostitute for my outfit. 

Another brother was in an argument with his wife, she left the house, he saw me in the room and asked me why I wasn’t at school, and slapped me twice on the face. 

There’s more but it’d be a novel. 

When it comes to having friends, I remember making friends with people who were alone or new because I was alone. I’ve always felt left out at school for some reason. I’ve always been the “big sister” or the “mum” but it only meant I wasn’t having fun and acting my age like the rest. I have a video of me in the bus with friends, and it zoomed on me and I was the only one sitting alone in the bus looking out at the window. I was smart at school, disciplined and became the head prefect at some point. Thought I’d make some friends from there, I didn’t. One time we planned a trip abroad as our project, I was the leader in the team and there weren’t enough money when we were in there, and that was the first time I seek a sugar daddy for that money. I’ve never felt so desperate and alone.

The teachers… gosh the amount of bad experience with them is worrying for my future kids. One of them actually gossiped about me with her colleagues in the staff room without realising I was literally sitting in front of her while my head was on the table, I looked up at her and she was like “omg sorry sorry”. That was why I always failed at her class because it was clear to me she didn’t like me. Not just her, other teachers didn’t like me either for whatever reason. So I kept going to teachers that liked me, one of them was my PE teacher and we would play badminton and tennis, I’d skip classes for this. This was in primary school. It got better at high school. 

I remember having this cousin who was likeable and everyone wanted to be her friend. She was like 4 years older than me, I was 10. One night I stayed over at her place with her family and there was our uncle living there. She showed me she was smoking cigarettes with him and I joined her, the room was filled with smoke I couldn’t see them, then she jumped in bed with him and showed me her giving him a head and making out. She then asked me to do it and I did it. I can’t look at them now and cut all contacts with them. I feel sick thinking about it. 

So I have no friends, my mother died when I was 12, I have no father since I was three, most of my siblings are assholes, I was sexually abused at 10, and so I went out and seek boys/older men at a minor age. Nothing was good about my life until just recently with my amazing partner. 

But it was too overwhelming to cope with these memories. Once my partner slept, I went to the kitchen and drink wine after wine. It was probably over 10 glasses of wine in a span of an hour. The pain was too much and crying so hard without trying to make any noises; it was actually hard work to cry this way. Eventually I wanted to end it all, so I took a towel, wrapped my neck with it, and I kept pulling the ends of the towel together, squeezing it on my neck until I could hear my heartbeat, my face felt “sucked”, my breathing was limited, and my eyes were blurry, I must have done it for at least fifteen minutes but in the midst of this all I felt really peaceful. It’s hard to describe it. I felt I was slowly losing my breath and felt like I was slowly dying but nothing was painful, in fact, once again, truly peaceful despite my struggle to breathe. 

At some point I was so weak I let go of my squeezing, my body fell to the floor and I genuinely felt I was losing every breath slowly. My partner came rushing towards me after he heard me and saved me.

People can be cruel, unintentionally and intentionally. If the world starts to be nice to everyone, to their sister, to their daughter, their son, their brother, to their friends, to their students, to the waiters, to the drivers… what a world that would be. I don’t know why I’m sharing this but perhaps, it’s a reflection to be truly grateful for what I have and care less about what I don’t have, and that whatever happened in the past doesn’t define me and I still can change my future. That’s the beauty of being alive. There will always be pain but they’ll fade away.",SuicideWatch,I wanted to die last night after realising people are just pure evil,2022-08-08 00:54:25

i've been bulied by family members and even outsiders, the bullying got so bad that my first suicide attempt was at 12, i tried to jump of a school building back when i was living in that shithole of a country,and ass expected the people that witnessed all judged and   bullied me further for it, whatever it deosn't really matter does it?

three years later i had another serious attempt as my bitch of a mother foundd out thjjat i was self harming and it was at that moment that i realized that i was alone and that it would be better if i stayed alone away from the bullshit superficial family that i had. 

so i decided to just leave it all behind and give up on whatever the hell was going on and i took my distance from all of those superficial relationships that barely even existed in the first place, i despised it all, i still do.

Then I was put on venlafaxine, then desvenlafaxine which did nothing. Then I went to a new psychiatrist(3 months ago) and he suggested I could have bipolar depression(not sure if this is the right term for it) and prescribed me lamictal.

They gave me three new medications which I can’t remember the names of but they were an ssri, an anxiety attack medication, and a sleep medication. A week later I got put into an outpatient program and now have a prescriber. My medication was switched again and I went on Wellbutrin and buspar or buspirone I don’t really remember. I mentioned that I felt numb and that it was concerning me and also suggested that I might have adhd since my psychiatrist was telling me that I might before I went to the hospital.

blahblahspamblahblah,1574887312,1,"Here’s the way my thought process goes with just about everyone, except for my boyfriend and family because I feel unconditionally loved and accepted by him:

“I’m afraid of being anxious around X. I don’t want that to happen since I haven’t seen x in a long time and I don’t wanna disappoint them by being like that. So it’s like if we hung out and x pointed out that I’m tired or being boring because I’m not my usual energetic self I’d feel bad. I just worry because I know x has better, healthier friends than me. And I don’t want to lose x, I want to have fun with them like I used to. 

But then if I didn’t hangout with x because I felt like my exhaustion and anxiety would ruin it that’s not making myself grow or get better at all. But I don’t feel accepted all the time except by boyfriend and family so I feel like I shouldn’t make new friends yet. 

Then I feel like if I lost x I’d become depressed due to loneliness or I’d rely way too much on boyfriend and family. 2 people. That’s not good. I need more close friends than that.

And lately it’s been a horrible series of downs &amp; I’m running low on hope.

I finally graduated college after failing so many classes. I got an incredible job. I felt successful for the first time in my life. And then I got fired. Two months into my new job, I just got too depressed and fell into old habits of sleeping too much. It messed with my schedule, and one week ago they told me to pack up. 

My birthday was a few days later, and it reinforced the fact that no one truly cares about me. I spent most of the day with my mom and sister who didn’t mention anything about my birthday except to comment in the morning that I seemed grumpy for it being my birthday. I ended up going home alone that night and making myself dinner because they didn’t feel like trying to figure out dinner.

i had started dating my friend and the girl of my dreams a few weeks ago, she was incredibly happy, and so was i. but two weeks into the relationship i attempted suicide(unrelated reasons). she was the driving reason i didnt go through with it. 
she found out, she said we should end it, out of desperation i told her my true feelings for her, but it did not work. worsened stuff actually. 


for that week i was at rock bottom, and so was she. she went from the happiest girl i had ever seen to a wreck. but i was in no shape to help.

after taking some time off to better myself i came out the gate ready to prove i’ve become stronger and fix the relationships my attempt had damaged, especially hers.
but when i had come back stronger than i ever was, she only worsened. not only her behavior, but how she saw me too.
it now seems like she wants nothing to do with me. i try talking to her, she pushes me away, or attacks my character and laughs it off “as a joke”.

in recent times things have not changed a lot despite me giving lots of space. its looking up a tiny bit. she has started talking to me again but only slightly, barely even bothers to really TRY to talk to me anymore, talks with everyone in our friend group but directs only negative emotions and insults disguised as jokes my way(she used to only talk to me).
hell, she doesn’t even look at me.
all the things i had achieved, that i worked for, i had always done for her. but now shes gone, and im just so…lost

after a breakdown today, im struggling on what to do.
she promised to support me, and as did i for her. 
but despite all the kindness and support i sent her way, i got none back.
despite me being nice, she only was a dick back.
i know i cant just ditch her, it will break her.
i know if i give this time, it could become like how it used to be(what my therapist thinks, hes probably right tbh).

After a terrible rollercoaster of emotions when my long term girlfriend cheated on me by fucking my bestfriend and hiding it for over a month. I felt insignificant. I left my house and started walking, with a belt to hang myself where i deemed fit.

If you are ever thinking about suicide, and finally act on it. Here is some advice. Text everybody; tell every person in your life that you love them. No matter how little they impacted your life, or how little they know you. If you have nobody. Write your feelings down. Write your final note and keep writing. Release all of your feelings at once, and take your time.
I sat with a belt around my neck at a local park for almost an hour. Thinking of who I would hurt. Until suddenly, my urge subsided for a moment. 

For the love of all things anybody can believe in, please stall. Ending your life is never a good solution, no matter how much you feel like you need to do it, or how little you're left with.

littlehelppls,1630073136,1,"So I'm working through my daily anxieties in therapy and the thought occurred to me - how am I supposed to trust myself while questioning the accuracy of all this?

I don't know when it happened but I've gradually become painfully insecure and I struggle a lot with feeling/seeming to appear stupid and incompetent. Even a typo makes me cringe as I imagine how I must be judged and mocked. When people laugh in public I immediately suspect they're laughing about me. I dislike even being around others at this point because being perceived at all is exhausting. And I understand these things can ironically sound selfish or inflated, which further complicates my feelings.

Anyway thoughts, feelings stemming from fear ... I want to let them pass naturally, not attach to them so much, not accept them as true. But my world starts unraveling when I examine them because I can no longer tell what's true and what isn't (I know, I know - black and white thinking). And I couldn't trust myself in the first place, or even identify which parts were me (though to be fair that's less anxiety and more a matter of existentialism), so how can I protect myself at a time when I especially need confidence but am supposed to be self-critical?

Are there specific things y'all tell yourselves when engaging in this work? ""My anxiety is not me"", ""it's okay to let even parts of my actual self go"", ""I can create new beliefs"", or just ""I trust myself""? How do you reconcile yourself to accept those statements? Are there exercises that strengthen your self-trust and help you separate your self from your anxiety?",Anxiety,Building self-trust while addressing anxiety,2021-08-28 00:05:36
pending_zone,1579172421,1,"Ok so this will be a bit long but whatever. I’ve been depressed for the past 4 year. I’m not claiming I have depression because I have never gotten clinically diagnosed but I do have many symptoms that are related to depression. Anyway since 8th grade I’ve been depressed and that unbearable sadness came from nowhere. The irony in all of this is that I was a huge narcissist that believed I was better and smarter than my peers and then all of the sudden I see myself as the worst thing that has ever been brought to earth. I was so confused the first two years (2016 - 2017) and didn’t understand why I went from being this happy extroverted person to this bitter, hateful and sad person. Eventually in 2018 I finally stopped trying to supress it (mostly because I couldn’t successfully supress my sadness) and finally faced it and man oh man was that a bad idea. I told one of my family members and that person said that I was being ungrateful for this life I was given and that I should just smile more as if that will solve my problems?
I’ve had my fare shared of mental break downs and even planned on jumping of a bridge but then I stop myself from. The reason is that I believe in heaven and hell and according to my religion you’ll end up in hell for all eternity if you k word yourself. 

Best thing is that this sadness that I have hinders next from doing basic thing like shower and maintain cleanliness in my bedroom. No joke I’ve lived in filth for 6 months last year because I was too unmotivated to clean my room. Im also a senior high school student and am pretty sure I’m going to fail.

Right now I have nothing to live for and no motivation to do anything. All i do during the day is to sit at my room and watch endless amount of YouTube vids and binge on random shows. I have no friends nor do  want any because of my non existent self esteem and social skills. I’m kinda waiting for a day where I lose it and actually go through k wording myself. I can never see myself getting married with a child or getting a job. It seems like I’m doing all of this to please others instead of myself. I could get help but in the country i went to a psychiatrist and said that I’m so depressed I wanna die, id be labeled insane and be put on horrible medications that will desensitize me immensely. The fact that the only reason I’m not killing myself is my beliefs says a lot.

SpicyPlaces,1558161780,1,"I (22F) won't go into details, but during a therapy session last week, my therapist said that much of what I've been discussing suggests I might have PTSD. She went through some questions with me from the DSM-V and said I do meet the criteria for it. I've always considered myself to have high-functioning anxiety and panic attacks. I guess I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that I could have PTSD. I knew that things weren't great at home, but it was only in the last four-five years that I started to realize how awful things have been/are. PTSD would explain the nightmares, the flashbacks, and the bouts of depression I experience, but I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm not sure what it means. 

To me, PTSD seems much more severe than anxiety. How do I know if it really is PTSD or if I'm just overly sensitive? And what do I make of it if it is? My therapist suggested living more in the present by practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques, but the present scares the hell out of me. I don't know how to /be/ anymore.

AngrySlavette,1570256359,5,"I don't know why.

She constantly talks to herself, mostly in a negative tone, about what she's doing and complaining about anything and everything in her path and thoughts, often bringing herself on the verge of tears.

She's in a bad mood most of the time, annoyed, stressed out, agitated, angry and nervous. 

Every task she's completing, she's describing out loud, with each inconvenience adding up to her negativity, so it starts off with giving herself a task out loud, then complaining, cursing every few seconds (she's not shouting), telling herself she can't do it, asking herself why nothing can go right, at times breaking into tears over small things or having rage outbursts (she doesn't break things, just shouts and curses). 

Doing chores, watching TV, browsing the internet. She goes on and on. It starts with each morning when she wakes up and ends late at night when she's falling asleep. And God forbid you're in her way, she's going to take it out on you when she reaches the point where she becomes agitated. 

It honestly wouldn't bother me if it wasn't so negative. It bothers my sister too. Often, she gets annoyed by what we do, like trying out outfits, our healthy eating patterns, going to the bathroom... It's hard to stay calm when every few minutes someone starts ranting about minor things, our anxiety goes through the roof and we often end up fighting. 

I talked to her about it multiple times, and she sometimes agrees it's problematic, other times she becomes defensive and takes it as a personal attack. She won't see a therapist either. 

We went through hard times in the past and she sacrificed herself for us. Our father was an abusive narcissist that tore our family down, and we still have many scars from him, so I try to understand it might be her coping mechanism of many years. 

But now we're trying to live normal lives, and we all support each other in recovery. 

I just want to help her live a better life, but it seems she's stuck in this negative mindset that prevents her to enjoy it. She's tried to have new relationships, but ends up not standing anyone that comes close. She only has one friend whom she sees once or twice a month.

All my siblings have acne. I have acne on my face and terrible acne scars on my back that haven't gone away after years of treatment.
My dad is short as FUCK. He's shorter than short people at 4'11. I'm thankful I even made it to 5'5.

I'm not some sort of incel who blames looks for all the issues in my life but god fucking damn as if having an unattractive face, smaller penis, entire face/back covered in acne scars isn't enough I'm short too?

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they didn't BEAT US AS CHILDREN EVERY DAY and tell us we owed them our lives for providing the bare minimum. Not a light slap ""beating"" no they used to whip me at 5 years old for spilling water or not eating the disgusting slop they called food. Child protection services had to intervene and my parents made me lie about my bruises. I was too young and stupid to understand why CPS was here or why I should lie.

Did I mention they come from a backwords shithole Muslim country and there's a chance I'm inbred? My uncle married his cousin and had 3 disabled Kids. Nice. 

My Mom had an arranged marriage at 18 to a 27 year old man and they hated each other. Guess forcing someone to marry a deformed midget 9 years old your age doesn't make for a good relationship.

They used to physically beat each other and made us take sides. Been like that my entire life. I remember being 6 years old and having to console my Mum and listen to my dad cry, confide in me how he hated my Mum while he dropped me off to school holy fuck I didn't even have a childhood.


I can't stop resentment towards people from happy backgrounds. Loving parents, being born pretty, coming from wealth, being taught life lessons. Everyone got something from their parents. Not me. 

Everything I have in my life I earned. Every penny I have I earnt myself. Every skill I have I learnt myself. 
They didn't teach me how to cook. Or clean. Or make meaningful relationships. Or help me when I got constantly bullied. Not even how to tie my shoe laces or brush my teeth.

bookDJnr1,1649751125,1,"I have serious problems with tiredness and am on the verge of being kicked out off school because I'm just too tired to go many times often because I couldn't get any sleep during the night.

Tonight I slept about 1 or 2 hours and then had to go on a 30 min car trip in taxi and then sit in school for my hours and then the same trip home and I honestly don't think I can make that sort of stuff.

I feel fucking pathetic saying that but it's true, I had a fucking breakdown over getting in the taxi while my mom yelled at me that I can't live like this and she's right.

I don't care it's the easy way out I think it'll be better.",SuicideWatch,I'm fucking pathetic,2022-04-12 18:12:05

I've been in mental hospitals several times myself, and I feel like if/when my next depressive episode hits itll be a lot harder to deal with when I'm working in the hospital. Idk. Maybe I'm just overthinking it. It just seems too stressful to me and I have no idea what I'm doing.",mentalhealth,Got a new job but now I'm having second thoughts,2020-01-25 14:00:16
