Chloe-anne-w,1,I’ve struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember. Today I can no longer cope with the pain I have to carry with me. I hoped that by achieving my nursing qualification I would find some meaning to my life. However I feel more depressed than ever. I wanted to help and make a difference to others lives but I feel I am not good enough. I’ve found wonderful friends and amazing partner but I feel that I only let you down. I feel a burden to those closest to me. All I ever wanted was to be happy but it seems that this is too much for me. This is no ones fault. I feel I am beyond help and the good times are not worth the fight.,SuicideWatch,I don’t feel like I will ever get better,2020-12-08 22:49:21,feel like ever get better,struggled mental health long remember today longer cope pain carry hoped achieving nursing qualification would find meaning life however feel depressed ever wanted help make difference others life feel good enough found wonderful friend amazing partner feel let feel burden closest ever wanted happy seems much one fault feel beyond help good time worth fight

lunactic98,1,"Hi guys, unsure if this has been discussed before. I'll try to keep it short so here goes. I've just turned 23 living in Northern Ireland still at home with my parents, I work as an operations manager for a courier firm so I'm earning quite good money and obviously living at home I have no major bills to pay out weekly or monthly which allows me to save vast majority of my earnings. Through the years of work I have saved quite a sizeable sum of money for a deposit for a house of my own for the future. With everything Ive said above you'd think I'd have no worries as I have a solid foundation much stronger than any of my friends who drink and party and spend every penny they get however I still find myself unable to sleep at night and basically catastrophising about the future and panicking about money and affording houses etc when my friends have no money and no plans however sleep soundly at night and far as I can see have absolutely no worries! This really bugs me as I know I shouldn't be fretting to the extent I am which makes me more annoyed that I'm fretting to begin with and just leads to a vicious circle worry that feels like something is sitting on my chest. Any help at all or even anyone who has a similar situation would be great as even now I'm tired but I can't sleep hence why I'm finally reaching out! I know this may be seem really small issue to those have much bigger and worse situations than me thought it is anxiety none the less and is driving me mad!

7:15am - Leave the house, head to first job. Endure hard physical and mental labor until 4:00pm.

4:00pm - Get to my shitty apartment and greet cat. Get undressed, masturbate, watch YouTube or play Xbox.

But before she told me that i kinda recognize that i have some weird dreams when i sleep. Before i take that medicine i had taken another one which didn't have such side effects but i also had an unpleasant dreams. What's worse is most of time dreams i have can be related with my past or trauma i have. It's really annoying and seems like it keep ruining my days. It's also been 3months. First time i just thought that was coincidence but after i dream those stuffs continuously i found my days got worse and worse.

DatNoobi,1,"On my father's side of the family there are two people, an aunt and an uncle, that have been in a mental clinic (or institution?) for extended period of time. For my aunt it was cuz her husband beat her early in their marriage. To my knowledge she started acting erratic to the point that she was taken to get help. For my uncle I don't know the answer. But he was kept there for a long time. This was in Mexico for context.

When it comes to my father it sounds like he has struggled with mental health in the past. He has always been kindof a proud man. But I know that in the years prior to my birth he would stare into blank space and not respond for a long time to his name. He also said weird shit about numbers according to my mother. I've done similar shit but independent of my dad and mostly cuz I sometimes like to figure out weird relationships between random numbers like the numbers on the side of a schoolbus. She even admitted to me that she thought he had some sort of mental problem.

What I'm worried about is how all this relates to me and my brother. We haven't been diagnosed with anything as of yet so I don't want to blow anything out of proportion. However its just concerning cuz it sounds like it might be a family thing and I'm not even sure if that's possible. I remember in fourth grade I saw a woman called Mrs. Crow and she would just sit me down and talk to me. According to my mom she was seeing red flags everywhere and it all came to a point when I said that I didn't want to live anymore at age 8 and when I promised her that I wouldn't ever kill myself.

Is there any way to get ""checked"" for mental illness? Again, I don't want to blow shit out of proportion about something I don't necessarily know about. But some stuff just has me concerned. I know my mother has tried helping me talk and meditate through my stresses and anxieties, but one of the points she stresses is not wanting me to be forced to take pills and ""become a zombie"". Which is a statement that I'm sure is uneducated but also an attempt at supporting me.

Can mental issues be familial? Is there a way to get checked? And should I be worried? I knew my last girlfriend was worried about it when I mentioned my familial track record.

Also sorry if anything I said was insensitive/uneducated.

I’m not sure if this helps, but I’ve been diagnosed with ocd and adhd.

masked_incompetent,1,"Hi everyone, I'm new here!

I work in the construction industry but in a coordination role that doesn't see me out in the field ever, I literally wear my work boots between the car and office. I love the job and the people I work with directly but I have minimal exposure and time to work with the people that are out there doing the work.

Recently my boss has asked me to develop some training materials that require me to go into the field and follow various workers around and shoot video to document what they do for training purposes.

The tech aspect of it is so appealing to me and getting to learn new things is always fun, but I'm finding the thought of going into the field and showing how green I am to these people absolutely terrifying. In my mind there is just worse case after worse case playing in my head: I'll delay production, hurt myself or someone else, etc.. I have maybe slept 6 hours over the last 2 days. Yesterday I lucked out with uncooperative weather. Today it is really nice outside, but I am just so exhausted I couldn't safely go into the field, so I took a day to relax and get some sleep.

I have suffered from anxiety for years but I have always been able to control it to a point where it wasn't a negative impact but this has been a mountain I can't seem to climb.

I feel like I am just making excuses not to do this and I know deep down that once I get out there and start to get a feel for it I will really like it and have a great time with the workers. My partner agrees with me and says that most of them would probably welcome the interest in what they do and the thought that they have been selected to be in the videos and I know she is right, but I keep ""psyching myself out"" for lack of a better term.

I was wondering what people do in these situations, and maybe some coping strategies or things I could do to better approach how I am thinking about this. Basically, what are some ways I could potentially mentally talk myself down and help me keep climbing this mountain?

Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading this long first post, and thank you for your support.",Anxiety,"Looking for some advice or coping strategies, please.",2022-07-06 20:29:19,looking advice coping strategy please,hi everyone im new work construction industry coordination role doesnt see field ever literally wear work boot car office love job people work directly minimal exposure time work people work recently bos asked develop training material require go field follow various worker around shoot video document training purpose tech aspect appealing getting learn new thing always fun im finding thought going field showing green people absolutely terrifying mind worse case worse case playing head ill delay production hurt someone else etc maybe slept hour last day yesterday lucked uncooperative weather today really nice outside exhausted couldnt safely go field took day relax get sleep suffered anxiety year always able control point wasnt negative impact mountain cant seem climb feel like making excuse know deep get start get feel really like great time worker partner agrees say would probably welcome interest thought selected video know right keep psyching lack better term wondering people situation maybe coping strategy thing could better approach thinking basically way could potentially mentally talk help keep climbing mountain advice greatly appreciated thank reading long first post thank support
Fram3y_,1,"I have no idea why this happens to me but for some reason I just get these waves of just sad and emptiness that last a couple of days, they used to be weeks or even months apart but now its happening every couple days.

For some reason I call them ""Bricks"", cause it feels like someone threw a brick at my face, the brick being a metaphor for my shitty down mood.

They happen at random times now, sometimes when I'm out with friends, with family, or just alone (more often when I'm alone since I'm alone a lot)

I'm not rly looking for a real answer as to what this i, more just looking to see if anyone has had similar experiences or is going through something similar to me at that moment.

This is basically a test to see if I'm not crazy.

I usually find myself thinking about happier memories that feel somewhat nostalgic to me even if some are still quite recent, and just knowing the fact that I'm never gonna be able to re-live that experience again.

Elliot-Green,4,"I had kind of forgot what my originally post secondary plan was. I wanted to try university for one semester, just to try it. But my plan was to go to school for acting. I had a school I was going to go to. But it never ended up happening, because people who “only want what’s best for me” decided that what’s best is to crush not only my hopes and dreams but also my sense of self worth. They convinced me I wasn’t skinny enough or pretty enough or talented enough to be an actor. Even though other people, who actually knew what they were talking about, told me otherwise. 

I had forgotten until today. I was thinking to myself, “why am I doing this.” I’m going to school, not because I want to, but because I need to be a full time student for my extended medical coverage. I don’t want to be doing this. But it’s too late to pursue my previous plan. It’s too late because now I believe what I was told. I look at myself and I’m disgusted. It feels like I was deluded to think I could make anything of myself. I might have been talented, but that doesn’t mean I would have been successful. 

Now though, I’m just lost. Even if this was the right decision, I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’ve had depression at least since I started middle school, possibly earlier. But I’ve never felt as lost and alone as I do now. I graduated in 2017 thinking I’d do one semester at uni then do what I really want. But that never happened and it never will. Maybe one day, I’ll want something else. But for the foreseeable future, I have no idea what I’m doing, because I have no idea what I want.

I'm tired. Really, I'm tired of all the shit I got to go through to ""live"". And I put in in quotation marks because I can barely call that a life. Endless cycle of the same exact garbage I have to put myself through. I have been on meds for about a year now because of suicide thoughts, and lately I've been like ""yeah, it's not too bad, I can go through this stuff and maybe it gets better"", but yesterday was the day that moved me to square 1 and made me realize I did 0 progress in a therapy since I started more than a year ago.

My therapist gave me a task of writing 16 things I can't do in my life and told me to write whatever comes in mind. And I did, and you know, looking back at this list makes me understand that I don't give a damn about a single thing there, I mean yeah, if it magically dropped on my head it would be nice, and I did write them genuinely, but I'm so freaking tired of trying to achieve anything in life so that list just humiliated me. I didn't realize that before I came back home from therapy, but now I get it.

I look at people around me who are full of ideas, energetic, chasing dreams, having ideas, etc, and all I have is void and numbness feeling. 

And now I've been thinking that suicide isn't such a bad of an idea, you know. What's the point of trying if all this still comes to square 1 and all I have in process is being tired.

werauka,1,"**(Fem 26)**I'm really worried about my life right now and for near future. I have stable life (no stress because of money etc), relationship  I always dream of, - my Partner is the best what I ever had but I know that He have enough of me and my behaviour and He think about breaking up with me what of course I understand. My mental health  is worse than ever. I cannot even tell myself how I feel. Is that even possible to doesn't know what I like, what I want from my life and what I'm good at?

I am afraid that I will be left alone and I may impose myself too much on my partner.

I have good days when  anxiety disappeared for a moment when I walking around people. I try to look nice every day to build my confidence and It's work for me when I see myself in the mirror and really LIKE  My appearance. I'm able to do basic stuff like shopping so It's not that bad if we talking about basic needs. BUT...

Normal Conversation does 't exist in my life. Finding topics to talk is nearly impossible. I'm THAT boring person. Problem is in here too.  I cannot focus in conversation in 100%, I can easily forget what someone told me 5 minutes before even if I really try My mind is like blocked. I feel so dumb and ashamed. It is killing me. I'm losing my partner because of that.  I'm really trying to get him all my attention but It's always look's I'm not. My thoughts are racing all the time.

I cannot get the correct sentence and that make's  me dumb AF. Also explaining something in normal discussion makes no sense when it goes from my month. Maybe I'm just stupid and I cannot accept that...

In work I'm most of the time with my Partner and situation when someone third appears and talk with Him makes me almost panic attack. And again my head tell me just ""don't say anything because You gonna be weird and  And You put my partner to shame"" .

Any advice how to work with that? This post is one of the first step to open for people and find the way to back to normal. ( It's stressful)

I thought I was getting better. It felt different for a while - The constant ache in my chest was gone, I felt.. lighter? I wasn’t exactly happy but I felt like everything was finally starting to look up for me.

Then suddenly it all came back out of nowhere. Nothing in my life changed, I just woke up one day and the ache was back and it was worse than ever before. 

I used to be able to act fine around people but I can’t even do that anymore. I spend most of my time at work trying not to break down, and most of my time at home crying my eyes out. I want to be fine I don’t want people to notice anything off but I just can’t control it this time. I just end up lashing out at people and I hate myself even more for it. They don’t deserve this from me. Why am I being so harsh on them? They should just leave me. I don’t even know what’s going on in my head anymore.

Today, while we were changing, I saw new scars. Honestly, I don't really know what new scars look like, but they were really red and I could see what looked like dried blood smeared near them.

I'm worried about her, but I don't want to be intrusive. She seemed kinda off today too. She was angrier than normal(she almost started a fight with someone from the boy's class), and she wasn't talking as much. After class, I heard her yelling to someone on the phone to not tell mom about something. I didn't hear what, though.

crystalocean1,1,"I'm 21 and going into my senior year of college but I've had anxiety basically since 2nd grade. Once I hit college, I found the #1 most helpful coping mechanism for me- **distraction**. For me, that looked like basically being busy from 10am-9pm every day during the week, living with my friends, and then working a part time retail job on weekends. Now that I've been home for about 5 months, my mental health is in the drain. My internship was cancelled, I currently cannot work my hospital volunteer job, I'm taking an online class but it's basically no work at all, and I can only see one of my friends and my boyfriend. I just recently started dating my boyfriend and he's SO awesome and I'm very happy to be in a relationship but I've never been in a worse place with my anxiety. 

I've tried it all- exercising daily, crafts, spending literally every day with my best friend, seeing my boyfriend as much as I can, taking an online class, applying to internships- nothing helps. I feel so useless, depressed and unproductive.

Every morning I wake up and just want to go back to sleep because there's no point. I'm too scared to apply for in person jobs because I'm health anxious and afraid of corona. Being at home with just my parents (they're great, nothing personal) is horrific for my mental health because I have no real distractions and my mental health has regressed to when it was at its worst in high school.

I really don't know what to do with no end to this in the foreseeable future. There are moments when I truly feel hopeless. I graduate college early in one semester, will be applying to PhD programs in the fall, but none of it seems worth it anymore because of the way the world is right now.

I spend every day feeling nauseous, anxious, extremely on edge, and afraid to leave my house. Every time I leave my house I come back wondering if this was finally the time I was exposed to corona.

I guess I just needed to vent and see if anyone found any helpful distractions beyond what I've mentioned.

I have severe panic attacks at random that send me into derealization (the feeling where you’re a stranger in your own reality... kind of like you’re in a dream, but more surreal). I cannot keep a job to save my life because I get tired of working for low wages but that seems to be all there is around me. I’ve failed out of college 3 times and for some reason, I keep going back. I’ve really been trying this time. But I guess some of my work turned in blank even though I worked extremely hard on it. I’m an idiot who forgot to save so I’d have to start over and turn it in for partial credit... so my 4th attempt at college and I’m already starting off with a D. I’m contemplating dropping out. 

With the degree, jobs in my area would offer me $80-$110/h, but that means that I’m wasting my life working for money that I can’t really use because I’ll always be working. Yeah, I can pay for a house. Go home to that house, sleep, go back to work, repeat. So mundane. I can’t stand the thought of that being my life forever. Just working... 

I’ve been having super vivid nightmares of sexual abuse that I endured between the ages of 4 - 15, when I finally ran away and became homeless. I’m 24, I have 4 kids and only my youngest lives with me. My oldest I have no custody of due to homelessness, my middle two live with their grandma due to a bad breakup between their dad and I when I had nowhere to go. They call their grandma mommy. They never want to stay with me. They call me by my first name. 

I’m living with constant guilt of how I treated their father. Things got verbally and physically abusive on both ends. Him and his friends never let me live it down so I’m stuck dealing with the guilt of that consistently. Even when I’m not asking for it. They’ll harass me online behind fake profiles. They’ll send cow shit to my house. Cops won’t do anything. 

I’m married now, but I kind of just left my husband to take care of the bills on his own, he makes a decent amount but definitely not enough to keep us afloat. 

I have no joy. I can’t find fulfillment. I’m too scared to end it myself but recently, I’ve been welcoming death more and more. I don’t want to do this anymore.

Endlessgestures,1," 

This ain't it. My heart is racing, but I feel I can think more clearly. I have no one to talk to about this, no friend group I could send a group chat to asking for something real, something REAL, to distract me from these cravings, or to express my disappointment at myself for caving in to the craving. But, all in all, this isn’t it. There is no release in this world that would satisfy what I am seeking. 

This is in reference to my nicotine addiction. I went 12 days, longer than I have gone without in years, but relationship stress, insecurity, anxiety, discomfort and dissatisfaction with the present moment got to me, so I caved and went back to the nicotine.

This, for me, is very closely tied to my depression. Because I normally feel as if I am frozen. I don't know what to do, as in I literally do not know what to do with myself, and quitting the nic dick really heightened my anxiety surrounding that characteristic of my life.

But, this is not it. I feel no relief. My heart is just racing because that's what nicotine does. I feel as though I can think more clearly, but as someone who has used nicotine to self-medicate since adolescence, I know that it has actually destroyed my brain cells and in no universe am I thinking more profoundly because of it. And I am once again confronted with the fact that the relief I am seeking is simply not on the market.

Obadiah31,2,"I’ve struggled with depression for years now and have got better at coping with it. I used to have suicide ideation almost every day, and have attempted a couple of times. However, for the past year or so I have become less volatile but dissociate more and find myself feeling less attached and more disconnected from other people. 


During this 3 month vacation I’ve been incredibly bored and lonely, most days I just lie in bed gaming and sleeping, and my depression and derealisation disorder have gotten worse.

So basically what's been happening is that sometimes when I go for a walk, I will completely zone out all together. I don't mean like zoning out as in I'm daydreaming, I mean zoning out to the point where I can't even see things in front of me anymore, even if I'm not looking anywhere else. I tripped into a car one time, because I didn't see it there and the door was open. Another thing that happens is that sometimes I'll snap out of this zoning out, in the middle of a public place with no idea how I've gotten there. It's like several hours of my life just... skipped. Nobody's ever mentioned any strange behavior from me when I'm in these states, they just say that I go very quiet, which is something I do sometimes anyways. A lot of people in my family have been diagnosed with ADHD, and I think this may have something to do with that, but I don't want to just assume that's it. I was hoping someone that knows about this could help me, and maybe give me some sources for something so I can investigate what's going on further. It would be greatly appreciated, thank you :).",mentalhealth,Zoning out/completely forgetting entire hours of my life,2022-05-21 15:09:03,zoning outcompletely forgetting entire hour life,dont know im correct wanting ask anyone else issuewhat issue basically whats happening sometimes go walk completely zone together dont mean like zoning im daydreaming mean zoning point cant even see thing front anymore even im looking anywhere else tripped car one time didnt see door open another thing happens sometimes ill snap zoning middle public place idea ive gotten like several hour life skipped nobody ever mentioned strange behavior im state say go quiet something sometimes anyways lot people family diagnosed adhd think may something dont want assume thats hoping someone know could help maybe give source something investigate whats going would greatly appreciated thank

polkadotmouse,1,"I know my professors are as human as everyone else, but I get a lot of anxiety talking to ""real"" adults (I'm currently a sophomore in college). Anyone in a position of power, authority, or prestige, as well as if they're at least 5 years older than me, I get very anxious. I still feel internally like a child (might be the way I was raised, I live in a household where listening to parents was very much listening to authority), so I feel like everything that comes out of my mouth is coming from a place of naivety and ignorance.  

Eventually, I want to build strong, good connections with my professors. I'll need their help in letters of recommendation and references. I also like hearing them talk about their research (depending on the subject area), so I want to learn more about their subject areas. I try my best to go to their office hours, talk to them after class, but I still feel very anxious about the way they perceive me. I feel very awkward talking to them since I'm not sure if I should address them as a colleague, an authority figure, or some sort of grey area that hasn't clicked to me yet.  

On a side note, talking to my manager at my last job also gave me anxiety, especially since it was my first job and I felt very annoying with the requests I made since it was my first job. My manager didn't seem to mind, but I always feel like I'm bothering them like a dependent child.

gorgingmelons,3,"I've only stayed alive for as long as I have is because it'd hurt my mother. My mother has become toxic ever since she inherited wealth from her father's death and after she met her most recent awful husband. She's always been unable to be alone. She's always needed a man in her life regardless of how toxic the relationship was. Every man she's ever been with has been a horrible creature. My father was one of them of course. He was an abusive alcoholic. My mother bailed on us when I was 4. My father got worse and more abusive. Childhood was awful. My sister couldn't take it and left to try and live with our mother in another state when she was 13. I was 10 when she left and I too couldn't stay with my abusive father and lived with my mother at 14. 

Money has always been the most important thing in my mother's life. She was hardly motherly to my sister and me and always thought that just throwing money at us was how you raised a child. She never read to us, she never taught us, she never helped us. She always just threw us to the wolves.

After having an awful childhood from my abusive father, my absent mother, and the bullying I received at school, I developed severe anxiety and depression at 13 that only worsened as I got older. I was suicidal several times. My mother had the bright idea of getting me hooked on marijuana at 19 to ""chill me out"". That didn't go well and I became dependent on pot for the next 8 years as I could no longer cope with living in this horrible world sober.

I'm going off on a tangent. As I've commented before on here, I've tried therapy for a couple years, tried several different families of antidepressants, tried exercise for a couple years, tried college 3 times, tried to date, tried pot, don't have the money to leave the place I'm in to find a better life, tried clubs and meetups, nothing worked. I don't like people anymore and I don't want to deal with them anymore, especially not for another 50 more years. At this point I'm afraid if I don't kill myself I'll go postal and I'd rather not do that.

My mother, since acquiring her new wealth, has gone on multiple month-long vacations in Europe and Australia. She even bought herself a Porsche Boxster S. I've been struggling living on my own, trying to get an education and work. However, because I'm having trouble finding work now she considers me to be lazy. She's gone full Trumpian with the whole, ""your generation is lazy"" even though I've tried explaining to her with evidence that the world has gotten tougher to live in than when she was my age. I've now given up, there's no hope for her to understand.

I moved up to South Carolina from Florida to stay with my sister and try to find a job and a happier life. Florida is such a horrible place, everyone is just so evil and treat each other so poorly. After being in South Carolina for a month, I'm finding it to be the same. The people up here are just as bad as they were in Florida. And to make matters worse there are FAR fewer jobs here.

So fuck it, I tried making a big change to be happier and it failed. I give up, this world just isn't hospitable to people like me.

rockygirl1000,1,"Hello everyone. I’m a 23 year old female. 

This is a dumb thing that I know shouldn’t bother me, but it does. 

People always think I don’t do anything fun or leave my house. In the past, in college, people always made comments about how I never did anything fun and how I never left my dorm room and stuff like that. It bothered me a lot because I DID do fun stuff. They just didn’t know about it. It annoys me because people think they know all about me and they don’t. 

Years ago, my former friend in college made a comment about how I didn’t go to her Labor Day party because I was sitting in my dorm room doing nothing. First of all, I was busy that day and I just couldn’t go. Secondly, even if I was sitting in my room all day, that’s MY choice and it’s MY life and I can do whatever I want. I don’t owe anyone an explanation about what I do with my life. 

On another occasion, the same friend invited me to play a card game with some other girls in the dorm living area. I declined because I had to study and I just didn’t want to play. She brought this up later talking about how I never did anything fun and blah blah blah. The reason she thinks this is because my former roommate told her that I didn’t leave the room or go anywhere, which isn’t true. The roommate just assumed I didn’t because she never SAW me do it. 

I DO do fun things. These people don’t know everything that I do in my life. And I don’t post everything I do on social media. It’s annoying for people to always assume I don’t do anything fun when I do. 

Sorry for the rant I just needed to vent. 

I know I shouldn’t care about what people think of me and their opinions when it’s not even true, but it still bothers me. 

Any advice on this? Has anyone else experienced this? 

Thanks!",mentalhealth,People think I don’t do anything fun,2021-09-10 12:37:17,people think anything fun,hello everyone year old female dumb thing know bother people always think anything fun leave house past college people always made comment never anything fun never left dorm room stuff like bothered lot fun stuff know annoys people think know year ago former friend college made comment go labor day party sitting dorm room nothing first busy day go secondly even sitting room day choice life whatever want owe anyone explanation life another occasion friend invited play card game girl dorm living area declined study want play brought later talking never anything fun blah blah blah reason think former roommate told leave room go anywhere true roommate assumed never saw fun thing people know everything life post everything social medium annoying people always assume anything fun sorry rant needed vent know care people think opinion even true still bother advice anyone else experienced thanks

Now im divorced. 35. Good news: i got alimony to go to school for 3 years. bad news. too old. All my dreams are crashed into the ground. Even forgetting the normal dreams of wanting to be a musician and filmmaker that most people have to drop.

I want to be a software engineer. I hear about ageism in tech, now i dont know what to do with myself.

I dont think i can even have a normal career now. I shop up as an intern at 40...would they even accept me? I dont know what to do. My life is over.

Long story short i used the account i made pretending to be someone to joydibs on some items. It backfired and before I was completely traced, i admitted it. We all talked together and decided to just post a statement. We all posted a statement regarding what happened and i admitted to everyone what i did. Their public statements included that hopefully it will be the conclusion and that it is settled. I am still scared that i might go to jail for what i done and i havent taken a bath or ate ever since the day i admitted it to them. I am also getting paranoid and scared.

agentcornman,1,"Hi, sorry if this isn't the right place for this post, I'll delete if necessary. I've been a mess since I was like...10. constantly worrying about shit that isn't going to happen and letting it consume me entirely, to the point where I'm just sitting there staring off into space doing nothing except die on the inside. Shit with politics, like America and China bickering back and forth have caused me to get noticeably worse, thinking it will escalate into war. I'm on day 2 of a heavily restricted computer, (like...month 2 of restricted at all but that wasnt strong enough for my dumbass) so I cannot physically look up the things that are actively hurting me, so that's good. I do keep thinking about them however, and I'd like to know if there are any exercises or things I can do to help? Or any reassurance; really anything to help would be great. It was at a low point when covid was going around but since that's the new normal now I've gotten used to it, since I didn't go outside anyway. I just fear the worst, (nuclear war, or any kind of actual war for that matter) constantly. My anxiety in general since I've moved out of a previously horrible living situation into a good healthy one, has gotten a lot worse, to my surprise. 

sorry about all the rambling but any help would be appreciated. thank you.

Impossible-Shine-577,1,I tried to attempt back in december. I ended up being fucked over and hurt by people I consider my close friends. I feel so angry and so much hatred and bitterness towards them. I call them mean names in my head and just feel like i’m being mean. What they did to me was wrong but I feel like almost attempting to end my life made the anger 10x more exemplified. I feel mean hating them so much but it’s also like they went out of their way to be mean to me or cause problems. Is this normal to be so angry at people? They fucked me over before and after I tried to attempt and it led to the hopelessness and overwhelming feelings I felt made me want to end my life. Not blaming my attempt on them because that’s wrong but they put me in situations that triggered really negative feelings.,SuicideWatch,Anger after an attempt?,2022-05-27 23:17:03,anger attempt,tried attempt back december ended fucked hurt people consider close friend feel angry much hatred bitterness towards call mean name head feel like mean wrong feel like almost attempting end life made anger exemplified feel mean hating much also like went way mean cause problem normal angry people fucked tried attempt led hopelessness overwhelming feeling felt made want end life blaming attempt wrong put situation triggered really negative feeling

marlerr15,2,"My sister studied as a caregiver in TESDA and she studied about all things you need to learn about caregiving such as hygiene, assistance, medical procedures and mental health disorders like adhd, depression, anxiety and etc.

So this happened a few months ago but it just flew into my mind again, one evening my sister spoke to the family about me having adhd for she has been observing me for while and notice that i have some of the symptoms everybody shrouge it off and made some jokes about me saying im retarded and some stuff so i put in the back of my mind.

But before this happened there were already peculiar things i have notice about me 

1) I am really forgetful, i constantly lose my train of thought, i would come to a room to find something to only forget and go back and forth with it.

2) My temper is nasty, i would be mad at the slightest things, and my family hated that.

3) I can't sleep, my sleep schedule is so screwed, that i rather not sleep and look at the ceiling for hours.

4) i sometimes think i have either depression or anxiety but my thoughts immediately shut it down and think to myself that im faking and tell myself that im a terrible person for doing it.

5) I have instant mood swings.

6) i have no idea if im happy or not i don't what my emotions really are?

Gloomy_Way_1386,1,I mean I can’t help myself anymore… I feel like a truly wicked horrible person and if you knew much about me you’d feel the same way I (22 f) am the mother of a beautiful child and lately I just can’t seem to be good for her. I’m irritable. Uninterested in life. Unhappy. It’s not fair to her but I’ve given up on trying to help myself and come to the conclusion once she’s of age to understand I’ll do it if I haven’t by then but every now and then I get so down I worry I’ll do it on accident. When I’m alone in my car is the worst cause that’s when they really start to come through I’ve used music for years to drown it out but I don’t think I can anymore it’s louder then anything else I feel. Besides my love for her. I don’t wanna ask for help anymore. I don’t wanna talk about it anymore. I don’t want to make her life worse by not getting help but I’ve tried to understand this and I can’t. I’m starting to lose my grip and it’s hurting. I’m here so I can just get this off my chest cause no one else would understand and I’m hoping someone does.
